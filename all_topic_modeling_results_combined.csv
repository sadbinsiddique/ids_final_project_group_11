science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111457,18 killed in Russian attack on Zelensky’s home city,2025-04-05,"A Russian missile attack on the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih has killed at least 18 people and left dozens wounded, the BBC reported quoting Ukrainian officials. Nine of the dead were children, said President Volodymyr Zelensky, who grew up in Kryvyi Rih. Local officials said a ballistic missile had hit a residential area. Images showed at least one victim lying in a playground, while a video showed a large section of a 10-storey block of flats destroyed and victims lying on the road. Russia’s defence ministry later claimed a “high-precision missile strike” had targeted a meeting of “unit commanders and Western instructors” in a restaurant, and that up to 85 were killed. It provided no evidence. Ukraine’s military responded by saying that Russia was spreading false information to try to “cover up its cynical crime”. It said Moscow had fired an Iskander-M ballistic missile with a cluster warhead to maximise casualties. The attack, early on Friday evening, was among the deadliest on Kryvyi Rih since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, and comes as US President Donald Trump pushes for a ceasefire. Zelensky wrote on social media that at least five buildings had been damaged in Friday's strike: “There is only one reason why this continues: Russia doesn't want a ceasefire, and we see it.” The head of Kryvyi Rih’s defence, Oleksandr Vilkul, said a residential area was hit. NativeClick Ads “The missile exploded in the air... to injure more people,” he said. “Children were killed on or near a playground.” Serhii Lysak, the head of the Dnipropetrovsk region where Kryvyi Rih is located, said more than 40 people were treated for wounds, and the youngest was only three months old. Later on Friday, Vilkul reported more explosions, saying the city was under a ""mass"" drone attack that triggered fires in at least four locations. He said one elderly woman burned to death in a private house hit by a drone. Another five people were injured elsewhere. Military chiefs from both the UK and France met Zelensky in Kyiv earlier in the day to discuss plans for foreign peacekeepers to be stationed in Ukraine as part of a potential ceasefire deal. But there has been little sign of a let-up in the violence. Kryvyi Rih also came under attack earlier this week when a building in the centre was struck, leaving four people dead. On Thursday, Russian drone strikes on the north-eastern city of Kharkiv claimed another five lives, local officials said. Kryvyi Rih is about 40 miles (70km) from the front line in eastern Ukraine and with a population of 600,000 it is reputed to be the longest city in Europe.",18 kill russian attack zelenski home citi,russian missil attack central ukrainian citi kryvyi rih kill less 18 peopl leave dozen wind bbc report quot ukrainian offici nine dead child say presid volodymyr zelenski grow kryvyi rih local offici say ballist missil hit residenti area imag show less on victim ly playground video show larg section 10storei block flat destroi victim ly road russia defenc ministri late claim highprecis missil strike target meet unit command western instructor restaur 85 kill provid evid ukrain militari respond sai russia spread fals inform try cover cynic crime say moscow fire iskanderm ballist missil cluster warhead maximis casualti attack earli fridai even among deadly kryvyi rih sinc start russia fullscal invas 2022 come unit state presid donald trump push ceasefir zelenski write social medium less five build damag fridai strike on reason continu russia want ceasefir see head kryvyi rih defenc oleksandr vilkul say residenti area hit nativeclick ad missil explod air injur peopl say child kill near playground serhii lysak head dnipropetrovsk region kryvyi rih locat say 40 peopl treat wind young three month old late fridai vilkul report explos sai citi mass drone attack trigger fire less four locat say on elderli woman burn death privat hous hit drone anoth five peopl injur elsewher militari chief uk franc meet zelenski kyiv early dai discuss plan foreign peacekeep station ukrain part potenti ceasefir deal littl sign letup violenc kryvyi rih also come attack early week build centr strike leav four peopl dead thursdai russian drone strike northeastern citi kharkiv claim anoth five live local offici say kryvyi rih 40 mile front line eastern ukrain popul 600000 reput long citi europ,russian missil attack central ukrainian citi kryvyi rih kill less 18 peopl leave dozen wind bbc report quot ukrainian offici nine dead child say presid volodymyr zelenski grow kryvyi rih local offici say ballist missil hit residenti area imag show less on victim ly playground video show larg section 10storei block flat destroi victim ly road russia defenc ministri late claim highprecis missil strike target meet unit command western instructor restaur 85 kill provid evid ukrain militari respond sai russia spread fals inform try cover cynic crime say moscow fire iskanderm ballist missil cluster warhead maximis casualti attack earli fridai even among deadly kryvyi rih sinc start russia fullscal invas 2022 come unit state presid donald trump push ceasefir zelenski write social medium less five build damag fridai strike on reason continu russia want ceasefir see head kryvyi rih defenc oleksandr vilkul say residenti area hit nativeclick ad missil explod air injur peopl say child kill near playground serhii lysak head dnipropetrovsk region kryvyi rih locat say 40 peopl treat wind young three month old late fridai vilkul report explos sai citi mass drone attack trigger fire less four locat say on elderli woman burn death privat hous hit drone anoth five peopl injur elsewher militari chief uk franc meet zelenski kyiv early dai discuss plan foreign peacekeep station ukrain part potenti ceasefir deal littl sign letup violenc kryvyi rih also come attack early week build centr strike leav four peopl dead thursdai russian drone strike northeastern citi kharkiv claim anoth five live local offici say kryvyi rih 40 mile front line eastern ukrain popul 600000 reput long citi europ,1,state_unit_say_trump,0.2471042471042471,0.22007722007722008,0.03474903474903475,0.03474903474903475,0.22007722007722008,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,0.10424710424710425,0.04247104247104247,0.04247104247104247

Among the countries first hit with the 10% tariff are Australia, Britain, Colombia, Argentina, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. A U.S. Customs and Border Protection bulletin to shippers indicates no grace period for cargoes on the water at midnight on Saturday. The initial 10% baseline tariff took effect at U.S. seaports, airports and customs warehouses at 12:01 a.m. ET (0401 GMT), ushering in Trump's full rejection of the post-World War Two system of mutually agreed tariff rates. “This is the single biggest trade action of our lifetime,” said Kelly Ann Shaw, a trade lawyer at Hogan Lovells and former White House trade adviser during Trump's first term.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111480,Anti-Trump protesters gather in cities across US,2025-04-06,"Thousands of protesters have amassed in cities across the US to denounce President Donald Trump, in the largest nationwide show of opposition since the president took office in January, the BBC News reported. The “Hands Off” protest planners aimed to hold rallies in 1,200 locations, including in all 50 US states. Thousands of people turned out in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Washington DC, among other cities, on Saturday. Protesters cited grievances with Trump’s agenda ranging from social to economic issues. Coming days after Trump’s announcement that the US would impose import tariffs on most countries around the world, gatherings were also held outside the US, including in London, Paris and Berlin. In Boston, some protesters said they were motivated by immigration raids on US university students that have led to arrests and deportation proceedings. Law student Katie Smith said that she was motivated by Turkish international student Rumeysa Ozturk, whose arrest near Boston-area Tufts University by masked US agents was caught on camera last month. “You can stand up today or you can be taken later,” she said, adding: “I’m not usually a protest girlie.” In London, protesters held signs reading, “WTAF America?”, “Stop hurting people” and “He’s an idiot”. NativeClick Ads They chanted “hands off Canada”, “hands off Greenland” and “hands off Ukraine”, referencing Trump’s changes to US foreign policy. Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in annexing Canada and Greenland. He also got into a public dispute with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and has struggled to negotiate a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia. In Washington DC, thousands of protesters gathered to watch speeches by Democratic lawmakers. Many remarks focused on the role played in Trump’s administration by wealthy donors - most notably Elon Musk, who has served as an advisor to the president and spearheaded an effort to dramatically cut spending and the federal workforce. Florida Congressman Maxwell Frost denounced the “billionaire takeover of our government”. “When you steal from the people, expect the people to rise up. At the ballot box and in the streets,” he shouted. The protests come after a bruising week for the president and his allies. Republicans won a closely watched special Florida congressional election on Tuesday, but with slimmer margins than they had hoped. Wisconsin voters elected a Democratic judge to serve on the state supreme court, roundly rejecting a Musk-backed Republican candidate by almost 10 percentage points. In both states, Democrats sought to tap into voter anger towards the Trump administration’s policies and Elon Musk’s influence.",antitrump protest gather citi across unit state,thousand protest amass citi across unit state denounc presid donald trump large nationwid show opposit sinc presid take offic januari bbc new report hand protest planner aim hold ralli 1200 locat includ 50 unit state state thousand peopl turn boston chicago lo angel new york washington dc among citi saturdai protest cite grievanc trump agendum ring social econom issu come dai trump announc unit state impos import tariff countri around world gather also hold outsid unit state includ london pari berlin boston protest say motiv immigr raid unit state univers student lead arrest deport proceed law student kati smith say motiv turkish intern student rumeysa ozturk whose arrest near bostonarea tuft univers mask unit state agent catch camera last month can stand todai can take late say ad usual protest girli london protest hold sign read wtaf america stop hurt peopl idiot nativeclick ad chant hand canada hand greenland hand ukrain referenc trump chang unit state foreign polici trump repeatedli express interest annex canada greenland also get public disput ukrainian presid volodymyr zelenski struggl negoti peac deal ukrain russia washington dc thousand protest gather watch speech democrat lawmak mani remark focus role plai trump administr wealthi donor notabl elon musk serv advisor presid spearhead effort dramat cut spend feder workforc florida congressman maxwel frost denounc billionair takeov governmentern steal peopl expect peopl rise ballot box street shout protest come bruis week presid alli republican win close watch special florida congression elect tuesdai slim margin hope wisconsin voter elect democrat judg serv state suprem court roundli reject muskback republican candid almost 10 percentag point state democrat seek tap voter anger toward trump administr polici elon musk influenc,thousand protest amass citi across unit state denounc presid donald trump large nationwid show opposit sinc presid take offic januari bbc new report hand protest planner aim hold ralli 1200 locat includ 50 unit state state thousand peopl turn boston chicago lo angel new york washington dc among citi saturdai protest cite grievanc trump agendum ring social econom issu come dai trump announc unit state impos import tariff countri around world gather also hold outsid unit state includ london pari berlin boston protest say motiv immigr raid unit state univers student lead arrest deport proceed law student kati smith say motiv turkish intern student rumeysa ozturk whose arrest near bostonarea tuft univers mask unit state agent catch camera last month can stand todai can take late say ad usual protest girli london protest hold sign read wtaf america stop hurt peopl idiot nativeclick ad chant hand canada hand greenland hand ukrain referenc trump chang unit state foreign polici trump repeatedli express interest annex canada greenland also get public disput ukrainian presid volodymyr zelenski struggl negoti peac deal ukrain russia washington dc thousand protest gather watch speech democrat lawmak mani remark focus role plai trump administr wealthi donor notabl elon musk serv advisor presid spearhead effort dramat cut spend feder workforc florida congressman maxwel frost denounc billionair takeov governmentern steal peopl expect peopl rise ballot box street shout protest come bruis week presid alli republican win close watch special florida congression elect tuesdai slim margin hope wisconsin voter elect democrat judg serv state suprem court roundli reject muskback republican candid almost 10 percentag point state democrat seek tap voter anger toward trump administr polici elon musk influenc,1,state_unit_say_trump,0.375,0.0375,0.06666666666666667,0.03333333333333333,0.03333333333333333,0.1,0.09166666666666666,0.18333333333333332,0.041666666666666664,0.0375

The convoy of Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) ambulances, a UN car and a fire truck from Gaza’s Civil Defence came under fire near Rafah. Israel originally claimed troops opened fire because the convoy approached “suspiciously” in darkness without headlights or flashing lights. It said movement of the vehicles had not been previously co-ordinated or agreed with the army. Mobile phone footage, filmed by one of the paramedics who was killed, showed the vehicles did have lights on as they answered a call to help wounded people. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) insists at least six of the medics were linked to Hamas - but has so far provided no evidence. It admits they were unarmed when the soldiers opened fire. The mobile video, originally shared by the New York Times, shows the vehicles pulling up on the road when, without warning, shooting begins just before dawn.

Trump said he had spoken to leaders from Europe and Asia over the weekend, who hope to convince him to lower tariffs as high as 50% due to take effect this week. Trump's tariff announcement last week jolted economies around the world, triggering retaliatory levies from China and sparking fears of a global trade war and recession.

Israel’s military said about 10 projectiles were fired, but most were successfully intercepted. Israel’s Channel 12 reported a direct hit in the southern city of Ashkelon. Israeli emergency services said they were treating one person for shrapnel injuries, and teams were en route to locations of fallen rockets. Smashed car windows and debris lay strewn on a city street, videos disseminated by Israeli emergency services showed.

Shortly after the rocket firing, the Israeli military posted on X a new evacuation order, instructing residents of several districts in Deir Al-Balah city in the central Gaza Strip to leave their areas, citing earlier rocket firing. ""This is a final warning before the attack,"" the military warning statement said. Later, it said it struck the rocket launcher from which projectiles were launched earlier from the Gaza Strip. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on a flight to Washington for a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, was briefed on the rocket attack by his Defense Minister, Israel Katz.

In the statement, the media office described the actions as “one of the most horrific crimes against humanity in modern times,” accusing Israel of continuing to carry out brutal massacres against defenseless civilians in Gaza, with children being a primary target of airstrikes. “Over the past twenty days, Israel has committed a shocking act of genocide against childhood, with 490 children martyred in a series of barbaric attacks,” the statement read. “This brings the total number of martyrs during this period to 1,350.” The statement rejected Israeli claims that civilian casualties are merely incidental, instead arguing that the figures alone reflect a deliberate, systematic policy of targeting Palestinian children in violation of international law. Last weekend, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to escalate attacks on Gaza as efforts are underway to implement US President Donald Trump’s plan to displace Palestinians from the enclave. Nearly 50,700 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza in a brutal Israeli onslaught since October 2023, most of them women and children. The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants last November for Netanyahu and his former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.

Trump requesting him to postpone the application of US reciprocal tariff measures on Bangladesh for three months to allow the interim government to smoothly implement its initiative to substantially increase US exports to Bangladesh. ""We are the first country to take such a pro-active initiative"", he said in his letter, citing the visit of High Representative Dr. Khalilur Rahman to Washington DC in February. Ever since, the two sides have been working closely to identify specific actions. Bangladesh is also the first country to enter into a multi-year agreement to import liquified natural gas from the US. The centerpiece of Bangladesh's actions is to significantly increase imports of US agricultural products such as cotton, wheat, corn and soybean which will offer benefits to US farmers. Bangladesh has the lowest tariff on most US exports in the South Asian region. The Chief Adviser indicated further tariff cuts on US products are being fashioned, including top US export items such as gas turbines, semiconductors and medical equipment. Bangladesh will build dedicated duty free bonded warehouses for cotton to improve speed to market. ""We are eliminating certain testing requirements, rationalizing packaging, labelling and certification requirements and undertaking trade facilitation measures such as simplifying customs procedures and standards,"" the Chief Adviser added.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111511,Bangladesh strongly condemns Israel’s mass killing in Gaza,2025-04-07,"Bangladesh has expressed its strongest condemnation of the Israeli Occupying Forces’ continued mass killing and gross violations of human rights in the Gaza Strip. The foreign ministry said this in a statement on Monday. According to the statement, the Government of Bangladesh demands that Israel immediately cease all military operations, exercise maximum restraint, and abide by its duty under international humanitarian law. It said that Bangladesh strongly denounced the Israeli Occupying Forces’ indiscriminate aerial bombardment of densely populated civilian areas in Gaza with the overt intention of carrying out ethnic cleansing against the defenseless Palestinian population. Israel’s ongoing military attacks since last month's unilateral breach of the ceasefire have killed scores of Palestinians, mostly women and children as well as blocked the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza leading to a human catastrophe. Evidently, Israel has shown no regard to repeated international appeals and has instead engaged in an increasingly intense killing spree, said the foreign ministry. Bangladesh appealed to the international community, in particular the United Nations (UN) to discharge its moral and legal responsibilities by adopting immediate and effective steps towards the implementation of an unconditional ceasefire. Dhaka called for the cessation of all hostilities for the protection of lives of civilians and unobstructed passage of humanitarian relief to besieged Gaza. NativeClick Ads The foreign ministry reaffirmed the strong support of the Bangladesh Government for all the just rights of the Palestinian people, their right to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent and sovereign State of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. The Bangladesh government reiterated the necessity of returning to negotiation platform for permanent peace in the Middle East, which is vital for both regional and global stability. Bangladesh also appealed to all concerned to commit themselves to the path of diplomacy and dialogue to put an end to the violence and sufferings afflicting the Palestinian people. Bangladesh further remained steadfast and unequivocal in its call on the global community to work towards a two state solution of the Palestinian issue based on international law, United Nations resolutions, and the Palestinian aspirations for peace, dignity, and justice, said the statement.",bangladesh strongli condemn israel mass kill gaza,bangladesh express strong condemn isra occupi forc continu mass kill gross violat human right gaza strip foreign ministri say statement mondai accord statement govern bangladesh demand israel immedi ceas militari oper exercis maximum restraint abid duti intern humanitarian law say bangladesh strongli denounc isra occupi forc indiscrimin aerial bombard den popul civilian area gaza overt intent carri ethnic clean defenseless palestinian popul israel ongo militari attack sinc last month unilater breach ceasefir kill score palestinian mostli woman child good block entri humanitarian aid gaza lead human catastroph evid israel show regard repeat intern appeal instead engag increasingli intens kill spree say foreign ministri bangladesh appeal intern commun particular unit nation discharg moral legal respons adopt immedi effect step toward implement uncondit ceasefir dhaka call cessat hostil protect live civilian unobstruct passag humanitarian relief besieg gaza nativeclick ad foreign ministri reaffirm strong support bangladesh govern just right palestinian peopl right selfdetermin establish independ sovereign state palestin base pre1967 border east jerusalem capit bangladesh governmentern reiter necess return negoti platform perman peac middl east vital region global stabil bangladesh also appeal concern commit path diplomaci dialogu put end violenc suffer afflict palestinian peopl bangladesh remain steadfast unequivoc call global commun work toward two state solut palestinian issu base intern law unit nation resolut palestinian aspir peac digniti justic say statement,bangladesh express strong condemn isra occupi forc continu mass kill gross violat human right gaza strip foreign ministri say statement mondai accord statement govern bangladesh demand israel immedi ceas militari oper exercis maximum restraint abid duti intern humanitarian law say bangladesh strongli denounc isra occupi forc indiscrimin aerial bombard den popul civilian area gaza overt intent carri ethnic clean defenseless palestinian popul israel ongo militari attack sinc last month unilater breach ceasefir kill score palestinian mostli woman child good block entri humanitarian aid gaza lead human catastroph evid israel show regard repeat intern appeal instead engag increasingli intens kill spree say foreign ministri bangladesh appeal intern commun particular unit nation discharg moral legal respons adopt immedi effect step toward implement uncondit ceasefir dhaka call cessat hostil protect live civilian unobstruct passag humanitarian relief besieg gaza nativeclick ad foreign ministri reaffirm strong support bangladesh govern just right palestinian peopl right selfdetermin establish independ sovereign state palestin base pre1967 border east jerusalem capit bangladesh governmentern reiter necess return negoti platform perman peac middl east vital region global stabil bangladesh also appeal concern commit path diplomaci dialogu put end violenc suffer afflict palestinian peopl bangladesh remain steadfast unequivoc call global commun work toward two state solut palestinian issu base intern law unit nation resolut palestinian aspir peac digniti justic say statement,8,peopl_student_univers_gaza,0.09691629955947137,0.03524229074889868,0.14537444933920704,0.07048458149779736,0.18061674008810572,0.03524229074889868,0.0881057268722467,0.23348017621145375,0.039647577092511016,0.07488986784140969

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111516,Jatka Conservation Week on April 8-14,2025-04-07,"The government will observe ‘Jatka Conservation Week-2025’ starting from April 8 with the aim of protecting and boosting Jatka (young Hilsa) production. Fisheries and Livestock Adviser Farida Akhtar made this announcement at a press conference at the ministry's conference room on Monday afternoon. She said conserving jatka would boost hilsa production, helping to stabilize prices and ensure better market supply. The advisor mentioned that the interim government has implemented an effective action plan to make Hilsa affordable for common people and as part of this effort, Jatka Conservation Week will be observed during April 8 to 14. The theme for this year's event is “If Jatka Fishing is Stopped Hilsa will be Caught in Nets.” Jatka refers to a small Hilsa fish, measuring around 10 inches or 25 centimeters. A hilsa weighing one kilogram typically measures between 40 and 50 centimeters, and if it weighs more than 2 kilograms, it reaches about 60 to 62 centimeters. Through the Jatka Conservation Week, Jatka will be allowed to grow into a mature hilsa. During the 2023-24 fiscal year, the country produced 5,29,000 metric tons of Hilsa, contributing roughly 11 percent of the nation's total fish production. Hilsa also plays a significant role in the national economy, contributing over 1 percent to the GDP. Bangladesh is the world's leading producer of Hilsa, accounting for over 80 percent of global production, harvested from the country's rivers, estuaries, and seas. It ranks the first among the 11 Hilsa-producing countries. NativeClick Ads The Fisheries Adviser highlighted that the government not only enforces laws to protect Jatka but also significantly increased the amount of VGF (Vulnerable Group Feeding) food assistance for fishermen during the ban of hilsa fishing. In the 2023-24 fiscal year, 361,071 fishing families who stopped fishing Jatka were provided with 28,885 metric tons of VGF rice, distributed at a rate of 40 kg per month for four months. To protect mother Hilsa during its main breeding season, 13,707 metric tons of VGF rice were distributed to 566,565 fishing families, at a rate of 25 kg each, during the same fiscal year. Besides food aid, various types of assistance, including the provision of calf calves, are being offered to fishermen through the ""Hilsa Resource Development and Management Project"" to create alternative employment opportunities. The Fisheries Adviser urged everyone to cooperate in protecting Jatka. Jatka Conservation Week 2025 will be observed in 20 Hilsa-rich districts across the country, including Dhaka, Manikganj, Rajbari, Shariatpur, Madaripur, Faridpur, Munshiganj, Barisal, Bhola, Patuakhali, Pirojpur, Barguna, Jhalakati, Chandpur, Lakshmipur, Feni, Noakhali, Chattogram, Bagerhat, and Sirajganj.",jatka conserv week april 814,governmentern will observ jatka conserv week2025 start april 8 aim protect boost jatka product fisheri livestock advis farida akhtar make announc press confer ministri confer room mondai afternoon say conserv jatka boost hilsa product help stabil price ensur good market suppli advisor mention interim governmentern implement effect action plan make hilsa afford common peopl part effort jatka conserv week will observ april 8 14 theme year event jatka fish stop hilsa will catch net jatka refer small hilsa fish measur around 10 inch 25 centimet hilsa weigh on kilogram typic measur 40 50 centimet weigh 2 kilogram reach 60 62 centimet jatka conserv week jatka will allow grow matur hilsa 202324 fiscal year countri produc 529000 metric ton hilsa contribut roughli 11 percent nation total fish product hilsa also plai signific role nation economi contribut 1 percent gdp bangladesh world lead produc hilsa account 80 percent global product harvest countri river estuari sea rank first among 11 hilsaproduc countri nativeclick ad fisheri advis highlight governmentern enforc law protect jatka also significantli increas amount vgf food assist fisherman ban hilsa fish 202324 fiscal year 361071 fish famili stop fish jatka provid 28885 metric ton vgf rice distribut rate 40 kg per month four month protect mother hilsa main breed season 13707 metric ton vgf rice distribut 566565 fish famili rate 25 kg fiscal year besid food aid variou type assist includ provis calf calv offer fisherman hilsa resourc develop manag project creat altern employ opportun fisheri advis urg everyon cooper protect jatka jatka conserv week 2025 will observ 20 hilsarich district across countri includ dhaka manikganj rajbari shariatpur madaripur faridpur munshiganj baris bhola patuakhali pirojpur barguna jhalakati chandpur lakshmipur feni noakhali chattogram bagerhat sirajganj,governmentern will observ jatka conserv week2025 start april 8 aim protect boost jatka product fisheri livestock advis farida akhtar make announc press confer ministri confer room mondai afternoon say conserv jatka boost hilsa product help stabil price ensur good market suppli advisor mention interim governmentern implement effect action plan make hilsa afford common peopl part effort jatka conserv week will observ april 8 14 theme year event jatka fish stop hilsa will catch net jatka refer small hilsa fish measur around 10 inch 25 centimet hilsa weigh on kilogram typic measur 40 50 centimet weigh 2 kilogram reach 60 62 centimet jatka conserv week jatka will allow grow matur hilsa 202324 fiscal year countri produc 529000 metric ton hilsa contribut roughli 11 percent nation total fish product hilsa also plai signific role nation economi contribut 1 percent gdp bangladesh world lead produc hilsa account 80 percent global product harvest countri river estuari sea rank first among 11 hilsaproduc countri nativeclick ad fisheri advis highlight governmentern enforc law protect jatka also significantli increas amount vgf food assist fisherman ban hilsa fish 202324 fiscal year 361071 fish famili stop fish jatka provid 28885 metric ton vgf rice distribut rate 40 kg per month four month protect mother hilsa main breed season 13707 metric ton vgf rice distribut 566565 fish famili rate 25 kg fiscal year besid food aid variou type assist includ provis calf calv offer fisherman hilsa resourc develop manag project creat altern employ opportun fisheri advis urg everyon cooper protect jatka jatka conserv week 2025 will observ 20 hilsarich district across countri includ dhaka manikganj rajbari shariatpur madaripur faridpur munshiganj baris bhola patuakhali pirojpur barguna jhalakati chandpur lakshmipur feni noakhali chattogram bagerhat sirajganj,10,bangladesh_will_bank_also,0.04326923076923077,0.0625,0.2644230769230769,0.13942307692307693,0.028846153846153848,0.03365384615384615,0.057692307692307696,0.04326923076923077,0.052884615384615384,0.27403846153846156

I had presented a blueprint for a far-reaching reform to the nation within a very short time. We have to cross a long way, some of which are difficult, but we have to cross these in any way,” he said. Reiterating his call for reform in the judiciary, the CJ said this has become the synonym of the word ""reform"". Chief Justice Syed Refaat Ahmed handed over stipends among 10 meritorious students from ‘Syed Zafar Ahmed and Tabserunnesa Memorial Scholarship’ fund, named after his grandfather and grandmother.

According to the Israeli daily Haaretz on Monday, Netanyahu's plane flew ‘through a flight path about 400 kilometers (248 miles) longer to avoid flying over countries that might enforce the ICC arrest warrant issued against him in the case of an emergency landing.’ “Israel believed that countries like Ireland, Iceland, and the Netherlands could have acted to enforce the warrant,” Haaretz also said. It added that since the start of the Israeli war on Gaza, on October 2023, all Netanyahu's flights to the US crossed through Greece, Italy, and France to the Atlantic Ocean and then to the US. On his arrival in Washington, DC, Netanyahu was met with a protest demanding a ceasefire in Gaza and a prisoner exchange deal, Haaretz noted. On Thursday, Netanyahu arrived in Budapest on an official visit, defying the ICC's arrest warrant issued against him over war crimes in Gaza. Following his arrival, the Hungarian government announced exiting the ICC. Last November, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. Israel is facing a genocide case at the International Court of Justice over its military actions in Gaza, where it has killed more than 50,700 people since the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks by the Palestinian group Hamas.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111523,Trump threatens new 50% tariffs on China,2025-04-08,"Donald Trump has threatened China with an extra 50% tariff on goods imported into the US if it does not withdraw its 34% counter-tariff, as global markets continue to fall, reports BBC. Beijing retaliated on Sunday, following last week's decision by Trump to slap a 34% tax on Chinese imports as part of his ""Liberation Day"" that set a minimum 10% levy on nearly all of America's trading partners. In a social media post on Monday, Trump gave China until Tuesday to scrap its countermeasure or face the 50% tax. In response, the Chinese embassy in the US accused Washington of ""economic bullying"", and said that Beijing ""will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests"". If Trump acts on his threat, US companies could face a total rate of 104% on Chinese imports- as it comes on top of 20% tariffs already put in place in March and the 34% announced last week. There are fears that this could deepen a trade war between the world's two biggest economies and global rivals. In his post on Truth Social, Trump also warned that ""all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us [on tariffs] will be terminated!"" Also on Monday, the US president said he was not considering a pause on the global import tariffs to allow for negotiations with other countries. NativeClick Ads ""We're not looking at that. We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and there are going to be fair deals,"" he said. Trump said China had introduced its countermeasure ""despite my warning that any country that Retaliates against the U.S. by issuing additional Tariffs... will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs"". Beijing shot back, saying that ""pressuring or threatening China is not a right way to engage"". ""The US hegemonic move in the name of 'reciprocity' serves its selfish interests at the expense of other countries' legitimate interests and puts 'America first' over international rules,"" Chinese embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu said in a statement. ""This is a typical move of unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying."" Speaking from the White House, the US president said there could be both permanent tariffs and negotiations. ""We have $36tn (£28tn) debt for a reason,"" he said, adding that the US would be talking to China among other countries to make a ""fair deal and a good deal"". ""It's now America first,"" Trump said. The tariffs would come as a major blow to China's manufacturers, for whom the US is a key market for exports. China's top exports to the US include electrical products and other machinery, computers, furniture, toys, vehicles and equipment. The US's top exports to China are oilseeds and grains, as well aircraft, machinery and pharmaceuticals. Uncertainty around the tariffs led to a turbulent day on global stock markets. Markets worldwide have plunged since Trump announced the global tariffs. The value of US stock markets dropped sharply again on opening on Monday, while Europe's biggest markets, including London's FTSE 100, closed more than 4% down. Asian share indexes had nosedived on Monday, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index falling by more than 13%, its biggest one-day fall since 1997. However, most showed a slight correction on Tuesday with most bourses opening higher. The impact on the FTSE 100, America's S&P 500, Germany's Dax and Japan's Nikkei has been wide-ranging._Agencies.",trump threaten new 50 tariff china,donald trump threaten china extra 50 tariff good import unit state withdraw 34 countertariff global market continu fall report bbc beij retali sundai follow last week decis trump slap 34 tax chine import part liber dai set minimum 10 levi nearli america trade partner social medium post mondai trump give china tuesdai scrap countermeasur face 50 tax respons chine embassi unit state accus washington econom bulli say beij will firmli safeguard legitim right interest trump act threat unit state compani face total rate 104 chine import come top 20 tariff alreadi put place march 34 announc last week fear deepen trade war world two big economi global rival post truth social trump also warn talk china concern request meet u tariff will termin also mondai unit state presid say consid paus global import tariff allow negoti countri nativeclick ad look mani mani countri come negoti deal u go fair deal say trump say china introduc countermeasur despit warn countri retali u issu addit tariff will immedi meet new substanti high tariff beij shoot back sai pressur threaten china right wai engag unit state hegemon move name areciproc serv selfish interest expens countri legitim interest put america first intern rule chine embassi spokesman liu pengyu say statement typic move unilater protection econom bulli speak white hous unit state presid say perman tariff negoti 36tn debt reason say ad unit state talk china among countri make fair deal good deal now america first trump say tariff come major blow china manufactur unit state kei market export china top export unit state includ electr product machineri comput furnitur toi vehicl equip unit state top export china oilse grain good aircraft machineri pharmaceut uncertainti around tariff lead turbul dai global stock market market worldwid plung sinc trump announc global tariff valu unit state stock market drop sharpli open mondai europ big market includ london ftse 100 close 4 asian share index nosediv mondai hong kong hang seng index fall 13 big onedai fall sinc 1997 howev show slight correct tuesdai bours open high impact ftse 100 america sp 500 germani dax japan nikkei widerangingag,donald trump threaten china extra 50 tariff good import unit state withdraw 34 countertariff global market continu fall report bbc beij retali sundai follow last week decis trump slap 34 tax chine import part liber dai set minimum 10 levi nearli america trade partner social medium post mondai trump give china tuesdai scrap countermeasur face 50 tax respons chine embassi unit state accus washington econom bulli say beij will firmli safeguard legitim right interest trump act threat unit state compani face total rate 104 chine import come top 20 tariff alreadi put place march 34 announc last week fear deepen trade war world two big economi global rival post truth social trump also warn talk china concern request meet u tariff will termin also mondai unit state presid say consid paus global import tariff allow negoti countri nativeclick ad look mani mani countri come negoti deal u go fair deal say trump say china introduc countermeasur despit warn countri retali u issu addit tariff will immedi meet new substanti high tariff beij shoot back sai pressur threaten china right wai engag unit state hegemon move name areciproc serv selfish interest expens countri legitim interest put america first intern rule chine embassi spokesman liu pengyu say statement typic move unilater protection econom bulli speak white hous unit state presid say perman tariff negoti 36tn debt reason say ad unit state talk china among countri make fair deal good deal now america first trump say tariff come major blow china manufactur unit state kei market export china top export unit state includ electr product machineri comput furnitur toi vehicl equip unit state top export china oilse grain good aircraft machineri pharmaceut uncertainti around tariff lead turbul dai global stock market market worldwid plung sinc trump announc global tariff valu unit state stock market drop sharpli open mondai europ big market includ london ftse 100 close 4 asian share index nosediv mondai hong kong hang seng index fall 13 big onedai fall sinc 1997 howev show slight correct tuesdai bours open high impact ftse 100 america sp 500 germani dax japan nikkei widerangingag,1,state_unit_say_trump,0.6219512195121951,0.024390243902439025,0.08841463414634146,0.042682926829268296,0.036585365853658534,0.021341463414634148,0.03353658536585366,0.03048780487804878,0.01524390243902439,0.08536585365853659

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111525,Lebanon president meets US delegation amid latest Israeli strikes,2025-04-08,"An Israeli strike Monday in southern Lebanon killed one person, according to the Health Ministry, with Israel’s military saying it had “eliminated” a Hezbollah commander, reports arabnews. The attack was conducted by an Israeli drone which targeted a motorcycle repair shop in the border town of Taybeh, with Israel claiming to have struck “a commander in Hezbollah’s artillery system.” A Lebanese security source said the attack targeted “a motorcycle as its rider stopped in front of a motorcycle repair shop on the Taybeh-Adaisseh road, resulting in his death and a fire breaking out at the location.” Hezbollah later identified the deceased man as Mohammed Adnan Mansour. Under the terms of the ceasefire agreement, Hezbollah was meant to withdraw fighters from south of the Litani River and dismantle any remaining military infrastructure there. Israel was to withdraw all its forces from southern Lebanon but continues to hold five positions that it deems “strategic.” Lebanon’s President Joseph Aoun has urged Washington to pressure Israel to withdraw from the five border points, saying the ongoing troop presence “complicates the situation.” On Monday, the Lebanese government received a message from the US confirming the need to disarm Hezbollah and implement necessary reforms for the country to receive financial aid, with Washington anticipating swift action on these issues. NativeClick Ads A delegation from the American Task Force on Lebanon, headed by Edward Gabriel, conveyed the message to Aoun. Aoun said there is no place for any weapons or armed groups outside the framework of the Lebanese state. Aoun on Monday said the issue needed to be resolved “through communication and dialogue because, in the end, Hezbollah is a Lebanese component.” Authorities would soon begin drafting a “national security strategy,” he added. During a meeting with the delegation, Aoun reaffirmed Lebanon’s full commitment to UN Resolution 1701, commending the work of UNIFIL south of the Litani River. Aoun pointed to “Israeli violations of the ceasefire agreement,” saying that “Israel’s continued presence in the five hills it occupied will not be beneficial for Lebanon and will further complicate the situation. “Therefore, we call on the US to pressure Israel to withdraw from them,” he added. “The Lebanese Army, north of the Litani River, dismantled six camps that were under the control of Palestinian groups outside the refugee camps,” Aoun continued. “They are now empty, and the weapons found were either confiscated or destroyed.” Aoun confirmed that “the priority is to reduce tension in the south.” He added: “The will is there, and the UNIFIL are doing their job to the fullest. But we must take into account that they are bearing many responsibilities. Lebanon needs time to resolve matters calmly.” Aoun noted that “three weeks ago, the government approved the recruitment of 4,500 soldiers to boost our preparedness in the south.” He emphasized to the American delegation that “reforms and the disarmament of weapons are demands from Lebanon, as well as from the international community and the US. We are committed to working towards these goals, and building trust is a step we have already initiated.” Gabriel spoke about the “significant recognition of the efforts made by the Lebanese Army and the commendable work of the president.” He stated: “I understand that your contribution to this was extremely important, and there are still many tasks that need to be completed, which we have been made aware of. The sooner these are carried out, the quicker we can assist you.” Gabriel revealed that “a funding bill is being prepared in Congress for the upcoming year, along with three significant pieces of legislation included in the economic package.” Aoun also met on Monday with Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri to discuss the outcomes of the visit of US Deputy Envoy to the Middle East Morgan Ortagus to Lebanon last weekend. According to a political observer, the emphasis was placed on “expediting the approval of reform laws in parliament” after “constructive and positive” discussions with Ortagus.

""Our humanitarian colleagues tell us that across Gaza, Israeli attacks continue unabated, causing systematic, large scale civilian casualties,"" UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said at a news conference. The people in Gaza ""including many children, are being killed, injured and maimed for life,"" Dujarric said. ""Survivors across Gaza are being displaced repeatedly and forced into an ever shrinking space where their basic needs just cannot be met,"" he added. ""Overall, we estimate that nearly 400,000 people have been displaced yet again since the breakdown of the ceasefire. That's 18% of all Palestinians in Gaza,"" he said. Dujarric also emphasized that ""no arrangements to secure their safety and survival have been made — a responsibility that falls on Israel as the occupying power."" He warned that humanitarian aid efforts are at a breaking point and said: ""We cannot sustain this for much longer unless the crossings are reopened immediately for humanitarian goods and equipment that will be essential to the survival of people in Gaza."" Citing the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Dujarric reported that ""all attempts to pick up commodities have been brought in and dropped at the crossings have been denied,"" and that “most attempts to coordinate these movements result in access being denied."" NativeClick Ads On Israel’s killing of paramedics caught on video, Dujarric said that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is ""very much aware of the video and I think, like anyone who has seen it, is just shocked by those images.""

The Israeli army renewed a deadly assault on Gaza on March 18 and has since killed nearly 1,400 people, injured over 3,400 others, and shattered a January ceasefire and prisoner exchange agreement in the enclave.

More than 50,700 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza in a brutal Israeli onslaught since October 2023, most of them women and children.

The magnitude 7.7 quake on March 28 also injured 5,017 victims and 160 people remained missing as of Monday, according to Xinhua News. At the same time, humanitarian efforts in Sagaing Region have faced significant obstacles, with search and rescue operations unable to move forward without the military regime’s approval. According to Myanmar Now, victims of the earthquake in Myanmar are relying on local non-profit emergency response teams for search and rescue operations. Myanmar’s elected government in exile, the earthquake, which caused extensive damage, has resulted in at least 693 deaths in Sagaing Region, the National Unity Government (NUG) said. The death toll continues to climb, as rescue operations are delayed due to a shortage of heavy machinery and a slow response to residents trapped under the rubble. “Rescue missions are only done by manual labor as there is no heavy machinery, like backhoe, for clearing rubble,” a Sagaing resident was quoted as saying by Myanmar Now. “As a result, many people lost their lives unnecessarily.” In addition, volunteer-led rescue teams are required to obtain permission from the military regime by submitting details, such as the address of the affected building, to a junta office responsible for overseeing search and rescue operations, according to Myanmar Now.

They don't take anything practically,” Trump told reporters at the White House. Last week, Trump announced a 20 per cent tariff on European goods, in his all-out protectionist offensive, which is set to take effect April 9. Trump's comments came in response to the proposal announced Monday by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, seeking a bilateral tariff exemption for cars and other industrial goods. “We have proposed zero tariffs on industrial products... Europe is always ready to strike a good deal” with the United States, von der Leyen said during a press conference in Brussels. But “we are also ready to respond with countermeasures and defend our interests” against Trump's trade offensive, she warned. In comments Monday, Trump added that the EU's trade deficit would ""disappear fast"" if European countries moved to purchase American energy. “They have to buy and commit to buy a like amount of energy (to this trade deficit),” Trump said. NativeClick Ads Trump, who did not specify if such a purchase would mean the lifting of tariffs against the EU, said a deal would have to be worth $350 billion to cancel out the United States' trade deficit with the EU.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111546,Record global temperatures in March,2025-04-08,"Global temperatures hovered at historic highs last month, and Europe experienced its warmest March, suggesting international climate goals could be moving out of reach. The average temperature in March in Europe climbed to above 6 degrees Celsius (42.8 Fahrenheit), which is 0.26C (0.468F) above the previous hottest March in 2014. The average global temperature last month was 1.6C (2.88F) higher than in pre-industrial times, the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said on Tuesday. The findings, contained in C3S’s monthly report, underscore growing concerns that the international goal of limiting global warming by the year 2100 to 1.5C (2.7F) above pre-industrial levels is slipping out of reach. Scientists have warned that every fraction of a degree of global warming increases the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, heavy rainfall and droughts. Samantha Burgess, strategic lead at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, which runs the C3S service, noted that Europe experienced extremes in both heavy rain and drought in March. Europe last month recorded “many areas experiencing their driest March on record and others their wettest March on record for at least the past 47 years”, Burgess said. Scientists said climate change also intensified an extreme heatwave across Central Asia and fuelled conditions for extreme rainfall in countries like Argentina. NativeClick Ads Arctic sea ice also fell to its lowest monthly extent last month for any March in the 47-year record of satellite data, C3S said. The previous three months also set record lows. The EU monitor uses billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations to aid its climate calculations. Its records go back to 1940.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111555,Tariffs on China set to rise to at least 104%: Trump,2025-04-09,"US President Donald Trump is set to impose an astounding 104% in levies across all Chinese imports on Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced on Tuesday. This comes on top of Chinese tariffs that were in place prior to Trump’s second term, reports CNN. China was already set to see tariffs increase by 34% on Wednesday as part of Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs package. But the president tacked on another 50% after Beijing didn’t back off on its promise to impose 34% retaliatory tariffs on US goods by noon Tuesday, adding an additional 84% in duties. Earlier Tuesday, China’s Commerce Ministry said it “firmly opposes” the additional 50% tariffs on Chinese imports, calling it “a mistake upon a mistake.” The ministry vowed to escalate its retaliation on US exports. US stocks, which soared Tuesday morning, began moving lower following Leavitt’s comments. Markets ultimately ended the day markedly lower. The Dow fell 320 points, or 0.84%. The broader S&P 500 fell 1.57%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 2.15%. “Countries like China, who have chosen to retaliate and try to double down on their mistreatment of American workers, are making a mistake,” Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday. “President Trump has a spine of steel, and he will not break.” “The Chinese want to make a deal, they just don’t know how to do it,” she added. She declined to share what, if any, terms Trump would consider to lower tariffs on China. Asian markets largely tracked Wall Street’s losses, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 opening about 3% lower on Wednesday. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng also fell 3%. South Korea’s Kopsi and Australia’s benchmark ASX 200 index were each down about 1%. Along with increasing China’s overall tariff rate, President Trump also signed an executive order Tuesday night tripling tariffs on goods worth less than $800 from the country. As it stands, packages under $800 have been exempt from tariffs through the so-called “de minimus” exemption. NativeClick Ads Initially, those goods were set to face tariffs of 30% come May 2. But Trump’s latest executive order hiked the rates to 90%. This will impact Americans who order from sites like Shein, Temu and AliExpress, likely leading to higher prices of the goods. In February, Trump had initially imposed a 10% tariff on all Chinese goods, with no exceptions, tying it to the country’s alleged role in aiding illegal immigration and getting fentanyl into the US. Last month, he doubled those rates. China was America’s second largest source of imports last year, shipping a total of $439 billion worth of goods to the US, while the US exported $144 billion worth of goods to China. The mutual tariffs threaten to hurt domestic industries and are poised to result in layoffs. When Trump’s first term ended, the US charged an average tariff rate of 19.3% on Chinese goods, according to a Peterson Institute for International Economic analysis. The Biden administration kept most of Trump’s tariffs in place while also adding additional ones, bringing the average rate to 20.8%. Come Wednesday, the total average tariff on Chinese exports to the US will soar to nearly 125%._Agencies.",tariff china set rise less 104 trump,unit state presid donald trump set impos astound 104 levi across chine import wednesdai white hous press secretari karolin leavitt announc tuesdai come top chine tariff place prior trump 2 term report cnn china alreadi set see tariff increas 34 wednesdai part trump reciproc tariff packag presid tack anoth 50 beij back promis impos 34 retaliatori tariff unit state good noon tuesdai ad addit 84 duti early tuesdai china commerc ministri say firmli oppos addit 50 tariff chine import call mistak upon mistak ministri vow escal retali unit state export unit state stock soar tuesdai morn begin move low follow leavitt comment market ultim end dai markedli low dow fall 320 point 084 broad sp 500 fall 157 techheavi nasdaq composit slide 215 countri like china choose retali try doubl mistreat american worker make mistak leavitt tell report tuesdai presid trump spine steel will break chine want make deal just know ad declin share term trump consid low tariff china asian market larg track wall street loss japan nikkei 225 open 3 low wednesdai hong kong hang seng also fall 3 south korea kopsi australia benchmark asx 200 index 1 along increas china overal tariff rate presid trump also sign execut order tuesdai night tripl tariff good worth little 800 countri stand packag 800 exempt tariff socal de minimu exempt nativeclick ad initi good set face tariff 30 come mai 2 trump late execut order hike rate 90 will impact american order site like shein temu aliexpress like lead high price good februari trump initi impos 10 tariff chine good except ty countri alleg role aid illeg immigr get fentanyl unit state last month doubl rate china america 2 large sourc import last year ship total 439 billion worth good unit state unit state export 144 billion worth good china mutual tariff threaten hurt domest industri poi result layoff trump first term end unit state charg averag tariff rate 193 chine good accord peterson institut intern econom analysi biden administr keep trump tariff place also ad addit on bring averag rate 208 come wednesdai total averag tariff chine export unit state will soar nearli 125agenc,unit state presid donald trump set impos astound 104 levi across chine import wednesdai white hous press secretari karolin leavitt announc tuesdai come top chine tariff place prior trump 2 term report cnn china alreadi set see tariff increas 34 wednesdai part trump reciproc tariff packag presid tack anoth 50 beij back promis impos 34 retaliatori tariff unit state good noon tuesdai ad addit 84 duti early tuesdai china commerc ministri say firmli oppos addit 50 tariff chine import call mistak upon mistak ministri vow escal retali unit state export unit state stock soar tuesdai morn begin move low follow leavitt comment market ultim end dai markedli low dow fall 320 point 084 broad sp 500 fall 157 techheavi nasdaq composit slide 215 countri like china choose retali try doubl mistreat american worker make mistak leavitt tell report tuesdai presid trump spine steel will break chine want make deal just know ad declin share term trump consid low tariff china asian market larg track wall street loss japan nikkei 225 open 3 low wednesdai hong kong hang seng also fall 3 south korea kopsi australia benchmark asx 200 index 1 along increas china overal tariff rate presid trump also sign execut order tuesdai night tripl tariff good worth little 800 countri stand packag 800 exempt tariff socal de minimu exempt nativeclick ad initi good set face tariff 30 come mai 2 trump late execut order hike rate 90 will impact american order site like shein temu aliexpress like lead high price good februari trump initi impos 10 tariff chine good except ty countri alleg role aid illeg immigr get fentanyl unit state last month doubl rate china america 2 large sourc import last year ship total 439 billion worth good unit state unit state export 144 billion worth good china mutual tariff threaten hurt domest industri poi result layoff trump first term end unit state charg averag tariff rate 193 chine good accord peterson institut intern econom analysi biden administr keep trump tariff place also ad addit on bring averag rate 208 come wednesdai total averag tariff chine export unit state will soar nearli 125agenc,1,state_unit_say_trump,0.5642633228840125,0.03761755485893417,0.09090909090909091,0.03761755485893417,0.0219435736677116,0.050156739811912224,0.018808777429467086,0.04075235109717868,0.0219435736677116,0.11598746081504702

The four sectors are - eco-friendly ready-made garments, housing for the middle class, paint and dyeing industry and digital financial services. These things were said in the report titled ‘Country Private Sector Diagnostic’ of the World Bank Group at the Bangladesh Investment Summit 2025 on Wednesday. These sectors, it argues, are mature and politically feasible enough to be restructured in ways that could create millions of jobs, draw both local and foreign investment, and spark a ripple effect of productivity in other interconnected sectors. In recent days, there has been much talk about Bangladesh's investment scenario with the government taking steps to woo global investors. The four-day summit, somewhat overshadowed by concerns surrounding the new US tariff policy, which went into effect on April 9, is meant to provide a boost in this regard. For this, reforms are essential even while new deals and commitments are being made. With proper reforms, the WB report estimates, the construction sector alone could add over two million jobs annually by supporting new housing developments for middle-income families.",reform four sector will creat 35 lakh job,countri can carri necessari reform four sector possibl attract larg numb foreign invest estim will creat 35 lakh new job four sector ecofriendli readymad garment hous middl class paint dye industri digit financi servic thing say report titl countri privat sector diagnost world bank group bangladesh invest summit 2025 wednesdai sector argu matur polit feasibl enough restructur wai creat million job draw local foreign invest spark rippl effect product interconnect sector recent dai much talk bangladesh invest scenario governmentern take step woo global investor fourdai summit somewhat overshadow concern surround new unit state tariff polici go effect april 9 mean provid boost regard reform essenti even new deal commit make proper reform wb report estim construct sector alon add two million job annual support new hous develop middleincom famili,countri can carri necessari reform four sector possibl attract larg numb foreign invest estim will creat 35 lakh new job four sector ecofriendli readymad garment hous middl class paint dye industri digit financi servic thing say report titl countri privat sector diagnost world bank group bangladesh invest summit 2025 wednesdai sector argu matur polit feasibl enough restructur wai creat million job draw local foreign invest spark rippl effect product interconnect sector recent dai much talk bangladesh invest scenario governmentern take step woo global investor fourdai summit somewhat overshadow concern surround new unit state tariff polici go effect april 9 mean provid boost regard reform essenti even new deal commit make proper reform wb report estim construct sector alon add two million job annual support new hous develop middleincom famili,3,countri_bangladesh_chang_climat,0.08280254777070063,0.06369426751592357,0.2356687898089172,0.12101910828025478,0.03821656050955414,0.044585987261146494,0.07006369426751592,0.05732484076433121,0.07006369426751592,0.21656050955414013

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111565,India cancels transshipment facility for Bangladesh,2025-04-09,"India has canceled the transshipment facility that allowed Bangladesh to transport commodities to third countries using Indian territory. Now, there will be no scope to export Bangladeshi products to Nepal and Bhutan through the land route. The Indian Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) issued a circular on Tuesday, officially withdrawing the transshipment facility. At the same time, it repealed its previous order dated 29 June 2020, which had enabled the transshipment. According to information available on the CBIC’s official website, the 2020 order permitted Bangladeshi exports to third countries to transit through Indian customs stations and exit via other ports or airports within India. This arrangement, known as transshipment, enabled Bangladeshi cargo to reach Nepal and Bhutan by passing through Indian land routes and switching transport vehicles at designated customs points. The new order stipulates that the facility is no longer valid. However, goods that are already in transit within Indian territory under the previous arrangement will be allowed to exit the country without hindrance. Under the transshipment process, Bangladeshi goods destined for Nepal and Bhutan travel through Indian land routes, where the cargo is transferred from one vehicle to another at the border and Indian customs checkpoints. The decision to revoke this facility is likely to impact trade logistics and export operations between Bangladesh and its landlocked neighbors.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111570,China imposes 84% tariffs on US goods,2025-04-09,"China has said it is raising its tariffs on U.S. products to 84%, up from its previously announced 34%, after President Trump's import duties on Chinese good went into effect April 9 at a rate of 104%. Mr. Trump's broad-based tariffs, which apply to imports of almost every nation, kicked in after midnight Eastern time in the U.S. The two countries have been involved in a game of tit-for-tat on trade, with Beijing standing firmly against each new tariff introduced by Washington. “The US escalation of tariffs on China is a mistake upon mistake, severely infringing upon China’s legitimate rights and interests, and seriously damaging the multilateral trading system based on rules,” China’s State Council Tariff Commission said in a statement announcing the fresh levy. The amped-up retaliation comes after China repeatedly warned that it would “fight to the end” if the US moved forward with further tariffs. On Wednesday, Trump’s additional levies on Chinese imports had originally been set to increase by 34 percentage points. But the president tacked on another 50 percentage points after Beijing refused to back down from the standoff. Prior to the most recent rounds of escalation, Trump had already imposed 20% levies on China.

He came up with the importance during a meeting with Baroness Rosie Winterton, the UK Trade Envoy to Bangladesh, at the State Guest House Jamuna on Wednesday. During the meeting, they reiterated their commitment to deepening bilateral ties, with Baroness Winterton acknowledging the ‘long and trusted history’ between the two nations. “We have a long history together, and we are pleased to see the direction of reforms being undertaken,” she said. Prof Yunus remarked that the country is passing through a transformative moment. “It’s a very critical time for us. We are focused on rebuilding institutions and reshaping priorities,” he said. Highlighting Bangladesh’s pressing need for a skilled healthcare workforce, Prof Yunus said, “We currently have a shortage of nurses. But nursing is not just a national concern—it’s a global necessity. We want to train more nurses not only for Bangladesh but also for the world.” The Chief Adviser invited UK support to strengthen Bangladesh’s under-resourced health sector. “Government-run health programmes are nearly non-functional,” he noted. NativeClick Ads “This is where the UK can play a vital role. Another promising area is pharmaceuticals. We urge you to support global access to vaccines by advocating for lifting patent protections so that every country can produce them affordably under a social business model,” the Chief Adviser said. The both sides also discussed broader areas of strategic cooperation, including education, the textile industry, defence, and aviation. Prof Yunus said, “We welcome UK support in improving our education system, modernising our textile sector, and exploring new areas of collaboration in defence and aviation.” The both leaders expressed interest in greater training, technology exchange, and long-term partnerships across these sectors.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111572,Trump steps back from cliff edge of all-out global trade war,2025-04-10,"For days, Donald Trump and his White House team had insisted they were fully committed to their decision to impose sweeping ""reciprocal"" tariffs on dozens of countries. They even derided a report on Tuesday that said the president was considering a 90-day pause – news that triggered a brief stock market surge, reports BBC today (April 10). But now that pause on higher tariff rates, with a few notable exceptions, is a reality. The reordering of the global economic order is on hold, and Trump's promise of a golden age of American manufacturing will have to wait. The White House has said that going big on tariffs and then hitting the pause button, before entering negotiations with individual countries, was the plan all along. ""We've had more than 75 countries contact us, and I imagine, after today, there will be more,"" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters shortly after the announcement. That framing from the White House is not surprising, of course. And it is difficult to ignore the investor panic, tumbling bond market and growing chorus of Republican criticism and public disapproval that preceded the announcement.

The Gaza Health Ministry said it expected the death toll from Wednesday’s attack in northern Gaza to rise, as civil defence teams and residents dug frantically to locate dozens of missing residents believed to be trapped under the rubble. The Israeli military said the raid targeted a senior Hamas fighter, but did not give his name, claiming that it had taken several steps to reduce harm to civilians. Ayub Salim, 26, a resident of Shujayea, told Al Jazeera that some victims were “torn to pieces” by the attack with “multiple missiles” that sent shrapnel flying. “Dust and massive destruction filled the entire place. We couldn’t see anything, just [heard] the screams and panic of the people,” he said. Reporting from Shujayea, Al Jazeera’s Ibrahim Al Khalili said civil defence forces and local residents had come together to pull trapped civilians from under the rubble. Most of the victims had come to live in the block after being “forcibly displaced”, he said. Israel resumed its aerial bombardment of Gaza on March 18 after a nearly-two-month truce with Hamas, and later expanded its ground assault across the territory. More than 1,400 people have been killed since Israel resumed its assault, according to Palestinian health authorities.",35 kill isra attack gaza residenti block,less 35 peopl kill dozen other wind isra attack residenti block gaza citi shujayea neighbourhood medic sourc tell al jazeera gaza health ministri say expect death toll wednesdai attack northern gaza rise civil defenc team resid dig frantic locat dozen miss resid believ trap rubbl isra militari say raid target senior hama fighter give name claim take sever step reduc harm civilian ayub salim 26 resid shujayea tell al jazeera victim tear piec attack multipl missil send shrapnel fly dust massiv destruct fill entir place see anyth just hear scream panic peopl say report shujayea al jazeera ibrahim al khalili say civil defenc forc local resid come togeth pull trap civilian rubbl victim come live block forcibli displac say israel resum aerial bombard gaza march 18 nearlytwomonth truce hama late expand grind assault across territori 1400 peopl kill sinc israel resum assault accord palestinian health author,less 35 peopl kill dozen other wind isra attack residenti block gaza citi shujayea neighbourhood medic sourc tell al jazeera gaza health ministri say expect death toll wednesdai attack northern gaza rise civil defenc team resid dig frantic locat dozen miss resid believ trap rubbl isra militari say raid target senior hama fighter give name claim take sever step reduc harm civilian ayub salim 26 resid shujayea tell al jazeera victim tear piec attack multipl missil send shrapnel fly dust massiv destruct fill entir place see anyth just hear scream panic peopl say report shujayea al jazeera ibrahim al khalili say civil defenc forc local resid come togeth pull trap civilian rubbl victim come live block forcibli displac say israel resum aerial bombard gaza march 18 nearlytwomonth truce hama late expand grind assault across territori 1400 peopl kill sinc israel resum assault accord palestinian health author,8,peopl_student_univers_gaza,0.07317073170731707,0.1402439024390244,0.06097560975609756,0.042682926829268296,0.2073170731707317,0.03048780487804878,0.04878048780487805,0.29878048780487804,0.042682926829268296,0.054878048780487805

The commerce adviser said this while talking to newsmen at the Secretariat on Thursday (April 10).

When asked about this, the adviser said, ""This (transshipment cancellation) was imposed on us suddenly. Immediately, I held a meeting with all our stakeholders yesterday. We do not feel any problem with this. We are taking all measures so that we do not face any problem in exporting products. I hope we will overcome this.” When asked what steps will be taken, the commerce adviser said, “Some of it involves infrastructure issues, and some involves increased costs- we are working on these areas. We hope to overcome the problem”. In response to a question about whether Bangladesh could retaliate by canceling Indian transshipment or transit facilities, as some social media users have suggested, the Commerce Adviser replied, “That is not under my jurisdiction. My concern is capacity building”. The Commerce Adviser further stated that the United States' temporary suspension of additional tariffs for three months would provide immediate relief.",india transship cancel will pose problem commerc advis,commerc advis sheikh bashir uddin say india sudden cancel transship facil will creat problem bangladesh commerc advis say talk newsman secretariat thursdai tuesdai central board indirect tax custom india revok order allow bangladeshi good transit indian territori 3 countri via transship ask advis say impos u suddenli immedi hold meet stakehold yesterdai feel problem take measur face problem export product hope will overcom ask step will take commerc advis say involv infrastructur issu involv increas cost work area hope overcom problem respons question whether bangladesh retali cancel indian transship transit facil social medium user suggest commerc advis repli jurisdict concern capac build commerc advis state unit state temporari suspens addit tariff three month provid immedi relief,commerc advis sheikh bashir uddin say india sudden cancel transship facil will creat problem bangladesh commerc advis say talk newsman secretariat thursdai tuesdai central board indirect tax custom india revok order allow bangladeshi good transit indian territori 3 countri via transship ask advis say impos u suddenli immedi hold meet stakehold yesterdai feel problem take measur face problem export product hope will overcom ask step will take commerc advis say involv infrastructur issu involv increas cost work area hope overcom problem respons question whether bangladesh retali cancel indian transship transit facil social medium user suggest commerc advis repli jurisdict concern capac build commerc advis state unit state temporari suspens addit tariff three month provid immedi relief,10,bangladesh_will_bank_also,0.19078947368421054,0.05263157894736842,0.03289473684210526,0.07894736842105263,0.11842105263157894,0.09210526315789473,0.09868421052631579,0.046052631578947366,0.09210526315789473,0.19736842105263158

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111593,Trump imposes 145% tariff on China goods,2025-04-10,"U.S. stocks tumbled on Thursday as investors assessed the worsening trade war with China, and President Trump clarified that he had raised tariffs on Chinese goods by a total of 145 percent since taking office. On Wednesday, the president said he was increasing the import tax on China to 125 percent, even as he postponed similar punishing levies on most other countries for three months. He also left in place new tariffs on automobiles, steel and aluminum. But on Thursday the White House put out a statement making it clear the 125 percent rise was in addition to a 20 percent tariff Mr. Trump had already imposed on China for its role in supplying fentanyl and its precursors in the United States. While tensions between Beijing and Washington showed no signs of easing, the European Union responded to Mr. Trump’s decision to put off implementing a hefty import tax on its goods by announcing it would also delay its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports for 90 days. After Mr. Trump announced the tariff pause, the S&P 500 posted its biggest daily gain since 2008. By midday Thursday, the index has dropped around 4 percent, a decline that deepened in the hour after the White House clarified the tariff on China was steeper than initially expected. The three-month delay on most country-specific tariffs, which Mr. Trump’s says are aimed at reversing bilateral trade deficits, did not temper the concerns of many economists who cautioned that the full repercussions from the trade war between Washington and Beijing would not be felt for weeks. A report released on Thursday showed that U.S. inflation eased more than expected in March, providing what economists say is likely to be only a temporary reprieve before Mr. Trump’s tariffs are expected to reignite price pressures.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111596,"Trump threatens sanctions, tariffs on Mexico",2025-04-11,"U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened Mexico with sanctions and tariffs in a dispute over water sharing between the two countries, accusing Mexico of breaking an 81-year-old treaty and ""stealing the water from Texas Farmers."" Under the 1944 treaty, Mexico must send 1.75 million acre-feet of water to the U.S. from the Rio Grande through a network of interconnected dams and reservoirs every five years. An acre-foot of water is enough to fill about half an Olympic-sized swimming pool, reports reuters. The current five-year cycle is up in October, but Mexico has sent less than 30% of the required water, according to data from the International Boundary and Water Commission. ""Mexico OWES Texas 1.3 million acre-feet of water under the 1944 Water Treaty, but Mexico is unfortunately violating their Treaty obligation,"" Trump posted on Truth Social. ""My Agriculture Secretary, Brooke Rollins, is standing up for Texas Farmers, and we will keep escalating consequences, including TARIFFS and, maybe even SANCTIONS, until Mexico honors the Treaty, and GIVES TEXAS THE WATER THEY ARE OWED!"" Trump said. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, in response, said on X that Mexico has been complying with the treaty ""to the extent water is available"" amid three years of drought. Mexico sent a proposal to U.S. officials on Wednesday, Sheinbaum said, to address the water supply to Texas, which includes short-term actions. Sheinbaum said she instructed her environment, agriculture and foreign ministers to immediately contact U.S. officials. ""I am sure, as on other issues, an agreement will be reached,"" Sheinbaum said. NativeClick Ads Mexican officials have routinely pointed to a historic drought fueled by climate change as a barrier to fulfilling water commitments, a scenario for which the treaty offers leniency, allowing the water debt to be rolled over to the next five-year cycle. The treaty also requires that the U.S. deliver 1.5 million acre-feet of water annually to Mexico from the Colorado River, an obligation that the U.S. has largely fulfilled, although recent deliveries have been reduced due to severe drought, something the 1944 accord allows for._Agencies.",trump threaten sanction tariff mexico,u presid donald trump thursdai threaten mexico sanction tariff disput water share two countri accus mexico break 81yearold treati steal water texa farmer 1944 treati mexico must send 175 million acrefeet water u rio grand network interconnect dam reservoir everi five year acrefoot water enough fill half olympic swim pool report reuter current fiveyear cycl octob mexico send little 30 requir water accord datum intern boundari water commiss mexico ow texa 13 million acrefeet water 1944 water treati mexico unfortun violat treati oblig trump post truth social agricultur secretari brook rollin stand texa farmer will keep escal consequ includ tariff mayb even sanction mexico honor treati give texa water ow trump say mexican presid claudia sheinbaum respons say x mexico compli treati extent water avail amid three year drought mexico send propos u offici wednesdai sheinbaum say address water suppli texa includ shortterm action sheinbaum say instruct environ agricultur foreign minist immedi contact u offici sure issu agreement will reach sheinbaum say nativeclick ad mexican offici routin point histor drought fuel climat chang barrier fulfil water commit scenario treati offer lenienc allow water debt roll next fiveyear cycl treati also requir u deliv 15 million acrefeet water annual mexico colorado river oblig u larg fulfil although recent deliveri reduc due sever drought someth 1944 accord allow forag,u presid donald trump thursdai threaten mexico sanction tariff disput water share two countri accus mexico break 81yearold treati steal water texa farmer 1944 treati mexico must send 175 million acrefeet water u rio grand network interconnect dam reservoir everi five year acrefoot water enough fill half olympic swim pool report reuter current fiveyear cycl octob mexico send little 30 requir water accord datum intern boundari water commiss mexico ow texa 13 million acrefeet water 1944 water treati mexico unfortun violat treati oblig trump post truth social agricultur secretari brook rollin stand texa farmer will keep escal consequ includ tariff mayb even sanction mexico honor treati give texa water ow trump say mexican presid claudia sheinbaum respons say x mexico compli treati extent water avail amid three year drought mexico send propos u offici wednesdai sheinbaum say address water suppli texa includ shortterm action sheinbaum say instruct environ agricultur foreign minist immedi contact u offici sure issu agreement will reach sheinbaum say nativeclick ad mexican offici routin point histor drought fuel climat chang barrier fulfil water commit scenario treati offer lenienc allow water debt roll next fiveyear cycl treati also requir u deliv 15 million acrefeet water annual mexico colorado river oblig u larg fulfil although recent deliveri reduc due sever drought someth 1944 accord allow forag,3,countri_bangladesh_chang_climat,0.17391304347826086,0.043478260869565216,0.266304347826087,0.07065217391304347,0.16847826086956522,0.043478260869565216,0.05434782608695652,0.06521739130434782,0.04891304347826087,0.06521739130434782

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111607,About 3 lakh crore taka has been laundered from country: Governor,2025-04-11,"Bangladesh Bank (BB) Governor Ahsan H Mansur has said, “About 2.5 to 3 lakh crore taka has been laundered from the country. Among them, there are some big industrial groups in Chattogram. The money laundered by Beximco is about 50 thousand crore taka. These are only big groups. We are not looking at the small ones for now.” The governor said this at a press conference on money laundering prevention activities and contemporary banking organized at the central bank’s Chattogram branch on Friday. “First, we will try to freeze the properties. We are talking to different countries, writing letters. We are talking to law firms. They will be hired soon. The properties will be frozen within the next six months. This will be the initial success”, he said. Stating that efforts are being made to bring the money back through negotiations rather than going through the court, Dr. Ahsan H. Mansur said, “All matters should not be settled through the court as it is out of court.” The concept of recovering laundered money is new to policymakers and they are constantly learning from foreign law firms as well as government officials.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111608,"Discontent grows around UN climate conference, required solution for planet",2025-04-11,"Some experts already have noted that the United Nation's climate conferences are failing to effectively address global climate change. Concerns have intensified due to the lack of a resolution regarding the climate fund at the COP29 conference in Baku. Poorer countries expressed dissatisfaction with this commitment, Environmentalists are starting to lose confidence in the United Nations Climate Change Conference. Environmentalists have commented that these conferences have failed to exert effective pressure on global leaders to protect the climate. Particularly at COP29, disappointment and frustration have arisen following the decision on new financing decision. Therefore, they are demanding accelerated aid and specific commitments regarding carbon credits and climate compensation at the upcoming conference (COP30). Environmentalists believe the UN should take a more robust role in this regard. In the future world, the impacts of climate change have emerged as the biggest challenge. It is not just the problem of a single nation or a specific region, but rather a global issue. Therefore, to address the challenges posed by climate change, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has been held annually since 1995. At the 29th United Nations Climate Conference in Baku, Azerbaijan, the focus was primarily on financing. Before the conference even began, there were controversies, doubts, and concerns. From November 11, representatives from 200 countries, totaling 85,000 individuals, engaged in discussions about funding, finance, adaptation, and promised commitments. The presence of large delegations from oil-producing countries and multinational corporations cast a shadow of skepticism and debate over the entire conference. Throughout the two-week event, various sessions sparked extensive discussions on these issues. On the final day, prolonged talks ensued due to a lack of consensus. Wealthy nations, including the European Union and the United States, agreed to provide $300 billion annually to climate funds by 2035, following extended discussions at Azerbaijan's COP-29 conference. However, while there was agreement on a deal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, critics and developing nations labeled the financial assistance as inadequate. Additionally, environmentalists expressed skepticism about how effective the agreement would be. This year, developing countries, including Bangladesh, sought $1.3 trillion annually to address the damages caused by climate change. High carbon dioxide emissions are a significant contributor to climate change, with 80% of these emissions attributed to developed countries. Consequently, calls for compensation for affected nations emerged from the Paris Climate Conference. Although there was some agreement on fund creation, there was little urgency regarding financing. To combat climate risks, the G7 coalition of affected countries, including Bangladesh, is demanding $500 trillion in grants from carbon-emitting nations. They have set a target for this new funding annually until 2030. However, during the COP-29 conference, developed and affected nations did not reach consensus on this matter. By 2024, global temperatures are projected to rise by at least 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels. The world is currently experiencing its hottest decade. The goal was to keep the increase in global temperatures below 1.5 degrees Celsius. Carbon-emitting countries are expected to contribute $10 billion annually to the UN Green Fund for addressing the climate crisis, yet temperatures have risen by 0.8 degrees Celsius instead of decreasing. Environmental activists believe that despite ongoing discussions at COP conferences, real change is taking too long. Many countries face accusations of not taking sufficient action against climate change, particularly developed nations, which are often deemed most responsible and yet fail to take adequate measures. Additionally, countries affected by climate change are claiming compensation, but developed nations are reluctant to assist. Environmentalists are also frustrated by the continued use of fossil fuels and the lack of investment in renewable energy sources. As a result, activists are advocating for alternative climate change conferences, arguing that traditional conferences are heavily influenced by large countries and corporate interests. In contrast, alternative conferences are said to prioritize the opinions of local communities, environmental organizations, and people from various backgrounds. While conventional conferences emphasize new ideas, technologies, and solutions, discussions often get mired in political disputes. In alternative conferences, there is a greater focus on solutions, and activists also wish to discuss the local impacts of climate change and potential remedies. NativeClick Ads Their demands include taking rapid and effective action against climate change, enforcing stricter targets for carbon emissions, providing adequate compensation to countries affected by climate change, increasing investment in renewable energy sources while phasing out fossil fuel use, and urging world leaders to adopt a stronger and clearer stance on climate change. Additionally, through alternative conferences, they seek to ensure compensation for countries harmed by the actions of developed nations, reduce fossil fuel consumption, explore new energy sources, change food production and distribution systems in the context of climate change, and find solutions by utilizing the knowledge and experience of local communities. In fact, such alternative climate conferences can play a crucial role in the fight against climate change, steering the world towards more practical and effective solutions. Anti-COP or alternative climate conferences are typically held alongside COP conferences, although they have sometimes taken place in separate locations. The first alternative climate conference began in 2009 in Copenhagen, surrounding the COP-15 conference. At that time, climate activists opposed the structure of the main conference, raising claims against protests, unnecessary discussions, and corporate interests. Following this, protests and the scope of alternative climate conferences expanded during COP-16 (2010, Cancun) and COP-17 (2011, Doha). Subsequently, environmentalists and climate activists began participating en masse in these alternative conferences. To understand why there are protests surrounding climate conferences, it is essential to first grasp the main topics of these conferences and the positions of various parties involved. Environmentalists protest in Baku, Azerbaijan, demanding that rich countries pay more to help poor countries combat the effects of climate change. Photo: Collected Evaluating Previous COP Conferences: The first COP1 conference took place in Berlin, Germany, from March 2 to April 7, 1995. This conference made decisions regarding joint efforts to combat global climate change. The UN Climate Change COP21 conference was held in Paris, France, in 2015. Based on the opinions of 196 countries, the Paris Agreement was recommended at this conference. The agreement determined to limit global warming to within 1.5 degrees Celsius. It was deemed reasonable to keep global warming within this limit to address droughts, irregular rainfall, salinity, and natural disasters worldwide. It was also stated that greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced by approximately 43% by 2030. Therefore, the Paris Agreement was a binding and groundbreaking climate change treaty, opening discussions on how to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. At the COP26 conference, the allocation of funds for building resilience against climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions was widely discussed. The issue of developed countries providing $100 billion annually to developing nations to combat climate change was addressed. The conversation also included visible plans to prevent greenhouse gas emissions and what further action plans could be added for the future. As a result, it is possible to keep global warming within the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit mentioned in the Paris Agreement. Among the key topics discussed at COP27 was the specific allocation of funds each year to help developing countries recover from climate-related disasters. The conference emphasized a strong demand to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 43% by 2030. The need for transparency and accountability from businesses in tackling climate change was also highlighted. There was a call for companies to develop concrete plans within the following year on how they would address climate change. Additionally, discussions were held regarding the Green Climate Fund, which proposed allocations of $211.68 million for developed countries and $70.6 million for least developed countries. Furthermore, the establishment of a special fund of $35 million for climate change was welcomed. Consideration of a new climate change fund by 2024, based on the needs and priorities of developing countries, was also ongoing. Ultimately, the UN's permanent committee was tasked with preparing a report on doubling the climate change fund by 2024. At COP28, nearly 200 countries agreed to gradually phase out the use of fossil fuels. Representatives from these countries committed to gradually halting the use of oil, gas, and coal to avoid the adverse effects of climate change, which climate experts view as a ""historic"" agreement in the past 30 years. However, there remains skepticism about what countries like Bangladesh and others affected by climate change will gain from this agreement. The cessation of fossil fuel use was prioritized at the conference. Meanwhile, the global temperature has started to rise due to the inability to reduce fossil fuel use. Yet, no government has ever reached a consensus on when or how this reduction will take place. At the latest COP29 conference, discussions focused on alternative allocations, raising concerns that previous initiatives may have fallen short. Some environmental activists have indicated that there may not be significant demands from developing countries at the upcoming COP30 conference this year. Expert Opinion: Dr. Mohammad Shamsuddoha, the CEO of Center for Participatory Research and Development (CPRD), stated that the coalition of affected countries, G7, has demanded $500 billion in grants from carbon-emitting nations to address climate risks. However, at the COP29 conference, developed and affected countries could not reach an agreement on this issue because developed countries seek guarantees on their investments in climate change. For example, if a developed country lends Bangladesh $100 to mitigate climate risks, it requires assurance that Bangladesh can repay this amount, with interest, after a specified time. Without such guarantees, the loan remains uncertain. He noted that during the latest conference, many poor nations affected by climate change expressed anger at the indecisiveness of wealthy countries. These disaster-stricken countries labeled the promised funds from wealthy nations, responsible for global pollution, as ""insultingly trivial."" He believes that organizing alternative conferences may not provide a good solution. Instead, it would be better to make the annual UN events (COP) more effective. Arifur Rahman, a Bangladeshi journalist working on climate change, stated, ""Climate change is one of the greatest environmental challenges faced by societies today. It has significant implications for energy, food, and water security, as well as health and safety for countries and people around the world."" However, he noted that the issues of impact and compensation for poor countries are not receiving adequate attention at COP conferences. It is crucial for these countries to send more representatives and present data on their losses to portray the real picture. The UN should also apply pressure on wealthy nations to ensure that affected countries can benefit. The EU representative Wopke Hoekstra, welcomed the new $300 billion climate agreement, stating that the COP29 conference will be remembered as the beginning of a new era in climate financing. Conversely, Mohamed Adow, director of the research organization Power Shift Africa, criticized the agreement, stating, ""This COP is a disaster for the developing world. The wealthy countries that claim to take climate change seriously have betrayed the planet and its inhabitants.""

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111609,Bangladesh to continue unwavering support for independent Palestinian,2025-04-11,"Bangladesh will continue to lend its unwavering support for the just cause of establishing an independent Palestinian state in accordance with multiple UN resolutions. This assurance was made when Foreign Affairs Adviser Md. Touhid Hossain and Information and Broadcasting Adviser Md. Mahfuj Alam held a meeting with International Criminal Court (ICC) Prosecutor Karim A.A. Khan KC on the sidelines of the 'Antalya Diplomacy Forum (ADF)2025' in Antalya, Turkey on Friday, said a Foreign Ministry press release. During the meeting, the advisers expressed deepest sympathy over the sufferings of the people of Palestine in the recent aggression. They appreciated ICC on its stance on the situation in Rohingya crisis and Gaza. Regarding the Rohingya issue, the advisers emphasized that accountability for the crimes against humanity perpetrated against the Rohingya community is a crucial factor in ensuring justice and the ultimate resolution of the crisis. The meeting discussed all aspects of engagements between Bangladesh and ICC. The Prosecutor of ICC lauded Bangladesh's unwavering stance for the cause of international justice system. The Foreign Adviser expressed Bangladesh's continued support to the Rome Statute and to the ICC. NativeClick Ads Hossain stated Bangladesh's interest in exploring tangible cooperation with ICC in training and skilling experts, academics, jurists. Both sides agreed to further enhance the level of existing engagements in the coming days. Bangladesh Ambassador to Trkiye and other senior officials from both the sides attended the meeting. The three-day ADF 2025 kicked off on Friday in Antalya with the theme, Reclaiming Diplomacy in a Fragmented World, under the patronage of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and hosted by the Turkish Foreign Ministry. This year's theme ‘Reclaiming Diplomacy in a Fragmented World’ reflects the pressing need for diplomacy to reassert itself as a stabilizing force, amid rising global divisions.

The organizers have condemned the silence of the international community and the passive role of Muslim leaders in the face of what they describe as ongoing war crimes and crimes against humanity. They have called on people from all religious and political backgrounds to join the march in a united show of support for the Palestinian people.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111611,Gaza is ‘hell on earth’: Red Cross,2025-04-12,"The president of the Red Cross described the humanitarian situation in Gaza on Friday as “hell on earth” and warned that its field hospital will run out of supplies within two weeks, Reuters reported. “We are now finding ourselves in a situation that I have to describe as hell on earth ...People don’t have access to water, electricity, food, in many parts,” Mirjana Spoljaric said at the headquarters of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva. No new humanitarian supplies have entered the Palestinian enclave since Israel blocked the entry of aid trucks on March 2, as talks stalled on the next stage of a now broken truce. Israel resumed its military assault on March 18. Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said 25,000 aid trucks had entered Gaza in the 42 days of the ceasefire and that Hamas had used the aid to rebuild its war machine, an allegation which the group has denied. Spoljaric said supplies were running critically low. “For six weeks, nothing has come in, so we will, in a couple of weeks’ time, run out of supplies that we need to keep the hospital going,” she said. The World Health Organization said supplies of antibiotics and blood bags were dwindling fast. Twenty-two out of 36 hospitals in the enclave are only minimally functional, Dr. Rik Peeperkorn told reporters in Geneva via video link in Jerusalem. The Red Cross president also raised concern about the safety of humanitarian operations. NativeClick Ads “It is extremely dangerous for the population to move, but it’s especially also dangerous for us to operate,” Spoljaric said. In March, the bodies of 15 emergency and aid workers, including eight members of the Palestinian Red Crescent, were found buried in a mass grave in southern Gaza. The U.N. and Red Crescent accused Israeli forces of killing them. The Israeli military said on Monday that an initial investigation showed that the incident occurred “due to a sense of threat” after it said it had identified six Hamas militants in the vicinity. Spoljaric called for an immediate ceasefire in order to release the remaining hostages held by Hamas and to address grave humanitarian issues in Gaza. Israel began its military campaign in Gaza in October 2023 after Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people and took some 250 hostages on a raid into Israel, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, more than 50,800 Palestinians have been killed and much of the territory has been reduced to rubble.",gaza hell earth red cross,presid red cross describ humanitarian situat gaza fridai hell earth warn field hospit will run suppli within two week reuter report now find situat describ hell earth peopl access water electr food mani part mirjana spoljar say headquart intern committe red cross geneva new humanitarian suppli enter palestinian enclav sinc israel block entri aid truck march 2 talk stall next stage now break truce israel resum militari assault march 18 israel ministri foreign affair say 25000 aid truck enter gaza 42 dai ceasefir hama us aid rebuild war machin alleg group deni spoljar say suppli run critic low six week noth come will coupl week time run suppli need keep hospit go say world health organ say suppli antibiot blood bag dwindl fast twentytwo 36 hospit enclav minim function dr rik peeperkorn tell report geneva via video link jerusalem red cross presid also rais concern safeti humanitarian oper nativeclick ad extrem danger popul move especi also danger u oper spoljar say march bodi 15 emerg aid worker includ eight member palestinian red crescent find buri mass grave southern gaza un red crescent accus isra forc kill isra militari say mondai initi investig show incid occur due sens threat say identifi six hama milit vicin spoljar call immedi ceasefir order releas remain hostag hold hama address grave humanitarian issu gaza israel begin militari campaign gaza octob 2023 hamasl milit kill 1200 peopl take 250 hostag raid israel accord isra talli sinc 50800 palestinian kill much territori reduc rubbl,presid red cross describ humanitarian situat gaza fridai hell earth warn field hospit will run suppli within two week reuter report now find situat describ hell earth peopl access water electr food mani part mirjana spoljar say headquart intern committe red cross geneva new humanitarian suppli enter palestinian enclav sinc israel block entri aid truck march 2 talk stall next stage now break truce israel resum militari assault march 18 israel ministri foreign affair say 25000 aid truck enter gaza 42 dai ceasefir hama us aid rebuild war machin alleg group deni spoljar say suppli run critic low six week noth come will coupl week time run suppli need keep hospit go say world health organ say suppli antibiot blood bag dwindl fast twentytwo 36 hospit enclav minim function dr rik peeperkorn tell report geneva via video link jerusalem red cross presid also rais concern safeti humanitarian oper nativeclick ad extrem danger popul move especi also danger u oper spoljar say march bodi 15 emerg aid worker includ eight member palestinian red crescent find buri mass grave southern gaza un red crescent accus isra forc kill isra militari say mondai initi investig show incid occur due sens threat say identifi six hama milit vicin spoljar call immedi ceasefir order releas remain hostag hold hama address grave humanitarian issu gaza israel begin militari campaign gaza octob 2023 hamasl milit kill 1200 peopl take 250 hostag raid israel accord isra talli sinc 50800 palestinian kill much territori reduc rubbl,8,peopl_student_univers_gaza,0.08835341365461848,0.07630522088353414,0.08433734939759036,0.09236947791164658,0.10040160642570281,0.05622489959839357,0.060240963855421686,0.3614457831325301,0.024096385542168676,0.05622489959839357

Around 10:20 a.m., a Cessna 310 carrying three people departed the Boca Raton Airport and was bound for Tallahassee International Airport before it crashed, the Federal Aviation Administration said. Michael LaSalle, the assistant chief of the Boca Raton Fire Department, confirmed that all three on board were killed in the crash. Meanwhile, another person was hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries after possibly driving through the fireball from the crash. The FAA said it and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) are investigating the circumstances surrounding the crash.

The spokesperson indicated that the attacks were carried out in support of the Palestinian people. “We affirm that confronting the ongoing American aggression against our country will not prevent us from continuing to fulfill our duty towards Gaza,” Sarea added. Israel’s Channel 12 News reported that a Yemeni drone was intercepted near the Dead Sea within the Jordanian airspace before it could reach Israel. The Jordanian army confirmed later on Friday evening that an unidentified drone entered Jordanian airspace and crashed in the Ma’in area of Madaba governorate, near the Dead Sea, and no casualties were reported. Even since Israel renewed its intensive strikes in March across the Gaza Strip, the Houthis have been launching frequent attacks against Israeli and U.S. targets. Earlier in the day, the Houthi military spokesperson claimed fresh attacks against the U.S. aircraft carrier, USS Harry S. Truman, and other U.S. warships in the northern Red Sea. NativeClick Ads Meanwhile, the U.S. Central Command said in a post on social media platform X that the strike group of the aircraft carrier “continues non-stop 24/7 operations against the Houthis despite the Houthis’ outlandish claims.” According to Houthi media outlets, the total number of U.S. airstrikes on northern Yemen since early Friday morning has increased to 30. The U.S. airstrikes targeted several locations in eastern and southern the capital Sanaa, the adjacent oil-rich province of Marib, and the western province of Hodeidah. In Sanaa, residents heard the loud sound of fighter jets flying over before and after they struck locations on the Mount Nuqum and Bani Hashish districts, both on the eastern outskirts of Sanaa. Also, the airstrikes hit locations in the Sanhan district, on the southern outskirts of the capital. There are no warning siren systems in Yemen to alert residents in advance of any possible air attacks. “All that we hear is the sound of speeding missile less than a second before it hit and exploded, then we hear the sound of fighter jets in full throttle,” a Sanaa resident Mohamed said. On March 15, the U.S. military resumed airstrikes against Houthi targets to deter the group from launching attacks against Israel and U.S. warships in the Red Sea. The Houthis, who control northern Yemen, said they would stop launching attacks if Israel stops its war on Gaza and allows the entry of essential food and medicine into the strip.",houthi claim drone attack israel tel aviv,yemen houthi group say statement fridai launch fresh drone attack citi tel aviv central israel xinhua report air forc carri qualit militari oper two isra militari target tel aviv us two drone houthi militari spokesperson yahya sarea say statement air houthirun awami leaguemasirah tv spokesperson indic attack carri support palestinian peopl affirm confront ongo american aggress countri will prevent u continu fulfil duti toward gaza sarea ad israel channel 12 new report yemeni drone intercept near dead sea within jordanian airspac reach israel jordanian armi confirm late fridai even unidentifi drone enter jordanian airspac crash main area madaba governmenternor near dead sea casualti report even sinc israel renew intens strike march across gaza strip houthi launch frequent attack isra u target early dai houthi militari spokesperson claim fresh attack u aircraft carrier unit statess harri  truman u warship northern red sea nativeclick ad meanwhil u central command say post social medium platform x strike group aircraft carrier continu nonstop 247 oper houthi despit houthi outlandish claim accord houthi medium outlet total numb u airstrik northern yemen sinc earli fridai morn increas 30 u airstrik target sever locat eastern southern capit sanaa adjac oilrich provinc marib western provinc hodeidah sanaa resid hear loud sound fighter jet fly strike locat mount nuqum bani hashish district eastern outskirt sanaa also airstrik hit locat sanhan district southern outskirt capit warn siren system yemen alert resid advanc possibl air attack hear sound speed missil little 2 hit explod hear sound fighter jet full throttl sanaa resid moham say march 15 u militari resum airstrik houthi target deter group launch attack israel u warship red sea houthi control northern yemen say stop launch attack israel stop war gaza allow entri essenti food medicin strip,yemen houthi group say statement fridai launch fresh drone attack citi tel aviv central israel xinhua report air forc carri qualit militari oper two isra militari target tel aviv us two drone houthi militari spokesperson yahya sarea say statement air houthirun awami leaguemasirah tv spokesperson indic attack carri support palestinian peopl affirm confront ongo american aggress countri will prevent u continu fulfil duti toward gaza sarea ad israel channel 12 new report yemeni drone intercept near dead sea within jordanian airspac reach israel jordanian armi confirm late fridai even unidentifi drone enter jordanian airspac crash main area madaba governmenternor near dead sea casualti report even sinc israel renew intens strike march across gaza strip houthi launch frequent attack isra u target early dai houthi militari spokesperson claim fresh attack u aircraft carrier unit statess harri  truman u warship northern red sea nativeclick ad meanwhil u central command say post social medium platform x strike group aircraft carrier continu nonstop 247 oper houthi despit houthi outlandish claim accord houthi medium outlet total numb u airstrik northern yemen sinc earli fridai morn increas 30 u airstrik target sever locat eastern southern capit sanaa adjac oilrich provinc marib western provinc hodeidah sanaa resid hear loud sound fighter jet fly strike locat mount nuqum bani hashish district eastern outskirt sanaa also airstrik hit locat sanhan district southern outskirt capit warn siren system yemen alert resid advanc possibl air attack hear sound speed missil little 2 hit explod hear sound fighter jet full throttl sanaa resid moham say march 15 u militari resum airstrik houthi target deter group launch attack israel u warship red sea houthi control northern yemen say stop launch attack israel stop war gaza allow entri essenti food medicin strip,5,pakistan_india_attack_say,0.05905511811023622,0.07086614173228346,0.04330708661417323,0.03937007874015748,0.3937007874015748,0.023622047244094488,0.03937007874015748,0.2559055118110236,0.027559055118110236,0.047244094488188976

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111617,Trump envoy meets Putin,2025-04-12,"U.S. President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff held talks with President Vladimir Putin on Friday in St. Petersburg about the search for a peace deal on Ukraine as Trump told Russia to “get moving”. The Kremlin said the meeting lasted for more than four hours and focused on ""aspects of a Ukrainian settlement"". The talks, Witkoff's third with Putin this year, were described by special envoy Kirill Dmitriev as ""productive"". Trump has expressed frustration with Putin over the state of talks. On Friday, he wrote on social media: ""Russia has to get moving. Too many people are [sic] DYING, thousands a week, in a terrible and senseless war."" It comes as Trump's Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg denied suggesting the country could be partitioned. The Times said that, during an interview with the paper, Kellogg had proposed British and French troops could adopt zones of control in the west of Ukraine as part of a ""reassurance force"". Russia's army, he reportedly suggested, could then remain in the occupied east. ""You could almost make it look like what happened with Berlin after World War Two"", the paper quoted him as saying. Kellogg later took to social media to say the article had ""misrepresented"" what he said. ""I was speaking of a post-ceasefire resiliency force in support of Ukraine's sovereignty,"" he wrote on X, adding: ""I was NOT referring to a partitioning of Ukraine.""

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111618,Germany to abolish 3-year citizenship path,2025-04-12,"Germany’s incoming government will abolish a fast-track citizenship path that allowed naturalisation after just three years for well-integrated immigrants, according to a coalition agreement published this week. The deal, reached between the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU)/Christian Social Union (CSU) alliance and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), removes a key feature of last year’s naturalisation reform. Introduced in June 2024 by the outgoing SPD-led coalition, the expedited three-year path required applicants to demonstrate advanced C1-level German and strong integration indicators such as community service or academic excellence. Critics within the CDU and CSU had labelled the route “turbo” naturalisation and argued that three years of residency was insufficient for full integration. While the fast-track path will be removed, the standard five-year route to citizenship will remain. This requires applicants to hold an intermediate B1-level of German and continuous residency in the country. Dual citizenship, a controversial topic in Germany’s immigration debate, will also be preserved. Prior to the 2024 reform, dual nationality with non-EU countries was largely prohibited. The change has seen a spike in applications, particularly among Germany’s large Turkish population. NativeClick Ads CDU leader and likely next Chancellor Friedrich Merz had voiced scepticism about dual citizenship but agreed to retain the policy as part of the coalition negotiations with the SPD. The coalition also ruled out revoking citizenship from naturalised dual nationals who support extremist ideologies. The CDU/CSU had previously floated the idea, prompting criticism from the SPD and migrant associations. Instead, the new government will explore legal options to expel non-citizens who threaten Germany’s democratic order._The Express Tribune",germani abolish 3year citizenship path,germani incom governmentern will abolish fasttrack citizenship path allow naturalis just three year wellintegr immigr accord coalit agreement publish week deal reach conserv christian democrat union christian social union allianc centreleft social democrat parti remov kei featur last year naturalis reform introduc june 2024 outgo spdled coalit expedit threeyear path requir applic demonstr advanc c1level german strong integr indic commun servic academ excel critic within cdu csu label rout turbo naturalis argu three year resid insuffici full integr fasttrack path will remov standard fiveyear rout citizenship will remain requir applic hold intermedi b1level german continu resid countri dual citizenship controversi topic germani immigr debat will also preserv prior 2024 reform dual nation noneu countri larg prohibit chang see spike applic particularli among germani larg turkish popul nativeclick ad cdu leader like next chancellor friedrich merz voic sceptic dual citizenship agre retain polici part coalit negoti spd coalit also rule revok citizenship naturalis dual nation support extremist ideologi cducsu previous float idea prompt critic spd migrant associ instead new governmentern will explor legal option expel noncitizen threaten germani democrat orderth express tribun,germani incom governmentern will abolish fasttrack citizenship path allow naturalis just three year wellintegr immigr accord coalit agreement publish week deal reach conserv christian democrat union christian social union allianc centreleft social democrat parti remov kei featur last year naturalis reform introduc june 2024 outgo spdled coalit expedit threeyear path requir applic demonstr advanc c1level german strong integr indic commun servic academ excel critic within cdu csu label rout turbo naturalis argu three year resid insuffici full integr fasttrack path will remov standard fiveyear rout citizenship will remain requir applic hold intermedi b1level german continu resid countri dual citizenship controversi topic germani immigr debat will also preserv prior 2024 reform dual nation noneu countri larg prohibit chang see spike applic particularli among germani larg turkish popul nativeclick ad cdu leader like next chancellor friedrich merz voic sceptic dual citizenship agre retain polici part coalit negoti spd coalit also rule revok citizenship naturalis dual nation support extremist ideologi cducsu previous float idea prompt critic spd migrant associ instead new governmentern will explor legal option expel noncitizen threaten germani democrat orderth express tribun,7,say_governmentern_parti_nation,0.11728395061728394,0.04938271604938271,0.20987654320987653,0.07407407407407407,0.037037037037037035,0.06172839506172839,0.21604938271604937,0.09259259259259259,0.030864197530864196,0.1111111111111111

DU Proctor Saifuddin Ahmed said the fire could have been set on the motif between 4:45 and 5:00am on Saturday as the members of the security mobile team went to perform Fajr prayers. “The act of setting fire might be done at that time,” he said. “On 12th April, around 04:50 AM, someone or some people set fire to the symbolic motif of the monstrous fascist among the various symbolic motifs kept inside the pandal erected near the southern gate of the faculty,” Dhaka University's Fine Arts Faculty dean's notification said. The university authorities have already decided to form a probe committee to investigate the fire incident and a general dairy has also been filed with Shahbag police station.",fire motif build noboborsho shobhajatra mysteri,fire two motif build observ noboborsho shobhajatra pahela baishakh schedul hold april 14 mysteri miscreant set fire motif sheikh hasina on seven large motif build bangla new year observ result damag nearbi motif good mani sai two motif burn even though motif intact sure someon deliber set fire two motif fire servic civil defens depart say investig will conduct matter du proctor saifuddin ahm say fire set motif 445 500am saturdai member secur mobil team go perform fajr prayer act set fire may do time say 12th april around 0450 someon peopl set fire symbol motif monstrou fascist among variou symbol motif keep insid pandal erect near southern gate faculti dhaka univers fine art faculti dean notif say univers author alreadi decid form probe committe investig fire incid gener dairi also file shahbag polic station,fire two motif build observ noboborsho shobhajatra pahela baishakh schedul hold april 14 mysteri miscreant set fire motif sheikh hasina on seven large motif build bangla new year observ result damag nearbi motif good mani sai two motif burn even though motif intact sure someon deliber set fire two motif fire servic civil defens depart say investig will conduct matter du proctor saifuddin ahm say fire set motif 445 500am saturdai member secur mobil team go perform fajr prayer act set fire may do time say 12th april around 0450 someon peopl set fire symbol motif monstrou fascist among variou symbol motif keep insid pandal erect near southern gate faculti dhaka univers fine art faculti dean notif say univers author alreadi decid form probe committe investig fire incid gener dairi also file shahbag polic station,4,will_dai_year_time,0.04861111111111111,0.19444444444444445,0.0625,0.20833333333333334,0.041666666666666664,0.09027777777777778,0.09722222222222222,0.08333333333333333,0.041666666666666664,0.13194444444444445

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111627,Biodiversity silent driving force of economy remains neglected,2025-04-12,"There is an ongoing decline in biodiversity, just as there is a simultaneous loss of biodiversity for many other living beings. One of the main reasons for this decline is climate change. Biodiversity plays an essential role in the global economy. But, this silent driving force of the economy remains neglected in most of the countries. Global biodiversity loss inflicts considerable economic damage measurable in monetary terms, severely affecting agriculture, tourism, and natural resource industries. Immediate impacts are evident, as Sub-Saharan Africa suffers approximately $2.1 billion in agricultural losses annually. Medium-term effects are seen in Southeast Asia, where deteriorating coral reefs have caused an estimated $3.7 billion decline in tourism revenue over recent years. Long-term projections in North America indicate that habitat degradation could reduce natural resource yields by over $4.5 billion in the coming decades. Business leaders and policy makers must prioritize sustainable environmental investments to counteract these quantifiable financial threats and ensure economic resilience. Biodiversity refers to the genetic, species, and ecological (ecosystem) diversity found among all plants, animals, and microorganisms inhabiting the earth's soil, water, and air. The basic needs of humans—such as food, clothing, shelter, and medical care—are sourced from a diverse array of plants and animals. The greater the diversity of species, the more stable and balanced the ecosystem becomes. A rich biodiversity is essential for sustenance, shelter, and overall well-being. Over the past 50 years, unprecedented changes in land and ocean use have been identified as the primary reasons for the loss of biodiversity and ecosystems. Human activities have altered three-quarters of terrestrial environments and nearly 66 percent of marine environments. For example, nearly half of the land in the United States that was once European settlements has been converted into agricultural land. In these transformed areas, yields are 70 percent lower than the national average. In efforts to increase production, a significant amount of biodiversity is being destroyed. However, it is time to consider the economic loss a country incurs by destroying biodiversity. Until we understand the importance of biodiversity to the economy, the issue will not hold significant weight for us. The extent of economic loss due to biodiversity loss in Bangladesh has yet to be determined. Although there have been several initiatives by the government, they have not met with success. The same scenario is observed in most countries around the world. Yet, some economic activities, while seemingly beneficial to humans, are causing significant damage to biodiversity, leading to various crises. These harmful activities are linked to essential sectors such as agriculture, energy, and fisheries. According to a recent report by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), activities aimed at short-term growth in these sectors are destroying biodiversity and escalating crises related to nature, climate, and human health. As a result, the global economy faces a loss of $25 trillion annually. The report warns that a lack of coordination in addressing crises is exacerbating financial losses. Biodiversity loss, climate change, water scarcity, food insecurity, and health risks are still being tackled separately. This not only increases the problems but also raises costs. For three years, 165 scientists have worked on this report, which indicates that industry owners are not considering the environmental and social damages incurred by their business activities. The overlooked costs range from $10 trillion to $25 trillion, which constitutes a quarter of the global GDP. The issue of biodiversity conservation gained significant attention during an international summit held in Brazil in 1992. The total number of species on Earth remains unknown today, and it is uncertain whether it will ever be known. It is estimated that between 5 million and 30 million different species inhabit the planet, with approximately 1.5 million species identified so far. Among these are 751,000 insect species, 281,000 other animal species, 250,000 flowering plants, 68,000 fungi, 26,900 mosses, 30,000 protists, 4,800 bacteria, and 1,000 viruses, among others. However, due to various reckless human activities, an average of 27,000 species is being destroyed each year. Scientists warn that if this continues, a quarter of all species on Earth could be wiped out by 2050. Important Factors to Consider in Assessing the Contribution of Biodiversity Before determining the economic contribution of biodiversity, we must identify the essential sectors from which we receive direct and indirect financial support. Beyond the sectors we can identify, there are countless others that quietly contribute to the national economy through biodiversity. NativeClick Ads The essence of biodiversity conservation lies in providing a safe environment for all living beings. Biodiversity is particularly reliant on water, soil, and forest resources. Life is unsustainable without water. All types of aquatic life, including fish, inhabit surface water. Water is a crucial nutrient, serving as the habitat for fish, which provide 20% of protein for 300 million people. When water becomes polluted, it means the habitats of aquatic life, including fish, are compromised. This is because a decrease in oxygen levels in polluted water makes it impossible for living beings to survive. For example, the Buriganga River, which suffers from pollution, has no fish or aquatic animals. Rainwater fills surface water bodies, with some of it seeping underground, providing people with drinking water. When water bodies are filled in, groundwater cannot replenish. As a result, the water table is dropping each year. During the dry season, many districts in the country face a drinking water crisis. All people on Earth depend on water, air, and food. In terms of livelihoods, approximately 2.6 billion people are engaged in fishing and agricultural production processes globally. About 80% of what we eat comes from agricultural products. Another major area of biodiversity is forests. Eighty percent of terrestrial species live in forests. Among 8,300 species of animals, 8% are extinct, and 22% are at risk of extinction. The livelihoods of nearly 1.6 billion people, including 70 million indigenous people, depend directly and indirectly on forest resources. Moreover, considering the oxygen produced by trees, all people on Earth depend on trees and forest resources. Trees also play an invaluable role in combating negative climate change. Of the 80,000 species of trees in the world, only 1% have been researched for their significant uses. Additionally, approximately 80% of people living in rural areas today use herbal medicines, which are primarily sourced from forest resources. Around 25% of the global population is estimated to work in agriculture. Estimating the economic value of biodiversity in agriculture and through the use of wild species for food is both challenging and controversial. Horticultural plant biodiversity can be highly profitable and provides opportunities for employment. In the UK, growth of ornamental plants was worth £1.7 billion in 2023. Biodiversity is a source of food, medication, and materials used in industry. It plays an important role in industry. It acts as a source of natural resources, materials, and products that are sold, consumed, or used in manufacturing. Recreation and tourism are also examples of human economic activities that rely on these benefits. In 2018, the WWF Living Planet Report argues that the whole global economy of US$125 trillion ultimately relies on nature. The benefits of biodiversity are often evaluated in an anthropocentric way and the inherent value of biodiversity, outside of its benefits to humanity, has been debated by economists. Despite these benefits, economic activities often result in harm to biodiversity, such as through deforestation. The majority of species have yet to be evaluated for their current or future economic importance. Raw materials, pharmaceuticals and drug production all directly and indirectly depend upon biodiversity. Impact of economic activity on biodiversity Even though biodiversity supports the economy, economic activity frequently degrades biodiversity, and since it offers financial incentives, it is frequently prioritized over conservation and restoration efforts. This adds to the worldwide decline in biodiversity, which has several causes, including overexploitation, pollution, habitat loss, and changes in land use. Boston Consulting Group (BCG) estimates that economic activities related to agriculture, infrastructure, fashion, and energy account for over 90% of the anthropogenic drivers of biodiversity loss. Furthermore, the IUCN estimates that mining, energy, infrastructure, and agriculture affect 79% of vulnerable species. It was projected that the loss of terrestrial biodiversity between 2000 and 2010 cost the world economy $500 billion. Long-term risks to society and the economy include an increased likelihood of pandemics, floods, and droughts due to ongoing biodiversity loss and environmental degradation. What Experts Are Saying: What We Should Do and What Solutions Are Available The Bay of Bengal is a blessing for Bangladesh. However, we are carelessly destroying this resource and missing out on the benefits of the marine economy. Biodiversity is crucial to the marine economy, which can be said to be the lifeblood of Bangladesh's national economy. Unfortunately, various factors are putting the marine life and ecosystem of the Bay of Bengal at risk. Instead of prioritizing the extraction of marine energy, we should focus on renewable energy sources such as offshore windmills. The government needs to pay special attention to developing wind energy management as part of its economic management expansion. Renewable energy is both cost-effective and sustainable, providing widespread and long-lasting benefits to the economy. Numerous organizations and institutions are fighting to protect marine habitats and wildlife. It is essential for everyone to be aware of marine life, as a significant part of the economy is tied to the marine sector. To protect biodiversity, all water bodies in the country must be safeguarded from encroachment and pollution. Necessary measures, including dredging, must be taken to enhance the water retention capacity of rivers and other water bodies. The use of all natural resources, including gas, electricity, and fuel, must be regulated, as water is used in their production. The use of tissue and paper should be limited. The sea, seabed, and coastal areas have become the largest zones for privatization. The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea granted coastal countries exclusive economic zones extending 200 nautical miles from their shores. As a result, one-third of the world's marine areas have been transformed into state-owned resources. This has primarily benefited colonial powers connected to remote island regions. France and the United States each received over 11 million square kilometers of marine area, while the United Kingdom obtained 6.8 million square kilometers, which is 27 times more than its land area. Governments in various countries have allowed private organizations access to marine resources. They have granted or sold private property rights in the sea. This has devastated the marine environment and reduced fish populations. Wastewater, chemicals, and plastics are being pumped into the sea. The extraction of mineral resources and tourism is destroying wetlands, mangroves, and other coastal ecosystems. Dr. Mohammad Taj Uddin, Dean of the Faculty of Agricultural Economics & Rural Sociology of Bangladesh Agricultural University, said climate change and human activities pose a significant threat to biodiversity in Bangladesh, similar to the situation worldwide. The adverse effects of climate change on biodiversity are evident in the vast areas of the Sundarbans coastal region of Bangladesh. Illegal deforestation and wildlife extermination, riverbank encroachment, pollution, deforestation, hill cutting, poverty, unplanned urbanization, water and air pollution, industrial waste, excessive use of harmful pesticides, and over-extraction of groundwater have all contributed to the current environmental crisis in Bangladesh. In light of this situation, urgent steps must be taken to conserve biodiversity in geological, aquatic, and marine environments. Dredging must be conducted to increase the navigability of rivers, and effective measures should be implemented for the proper execution of water agreements with India. Reserved forest areas should not be allocated for development projects. Development projects must be undertaken while maintaining a balance between development and biodiversity. It is essential to prevent indiscriminate deforestation and ensure proper management of protected forests. The public must be educated and made aware that forests and wildlife are integral parts of our lives. Professor Rashed Al Mahmood Titumir, Chairman of the Development Studies Department at Dhaka University, stated that past biodiversity targets have not been met. There is a need for several effective accountability mechanisms. First, there must be measurable quantitative targets. All stakeholders in society should know what percentage of land will be restored or how much pollution the government intends to reduce. Monitoring must include target-based milestones. Second, the state's understanding of life and ecosystems remains flawed, and there are significant gaps in the data. The quality of data must be improved. Ultimately, a proper accountability system is necessary. If world leaders wish to fulfill their commitments, this is crucial.

He called the rally one of the most powerful displays of solidarity with Palestine in recent memory. In a statement issued on Saturday (April 12), Ambassador Yousef Ramadan hailed Saturday’s mass rally in Dhaka—dubbed the “March for Gaza”—as a “historic declaration” of support that “will echo across borders and generations.” Thousands of people, including students, imams, artists and civil society members, gathered at Suhrawardy Udyan in Dhaka on April 12, waving Palestinian and Bangladeshi flags in a show of unity. The rally demanded an end to the Israeli occupation and justice for Palestinians. “Dhaka continues to surprise the world with its unparalleled sincerity,” said the ambassador. “Bangladesh has chosen to grant the Palestinian people renewed strength, encouragement, and moral immunity to continue their struggle for freedom and independence.” He described Bangladesh’s stance as “an irreversible decision” to remain on “the right side of history” and stand by Palestine without compromise. NativeClick Ads The statement paid tribute to the people who took part in the rally, thanking “every student who marched, every artist who painted, every imam who prayed,” and called them “brothers and sisters in hope, dignity and struggle.” “From the refugee camps of Gaza to the olive groves of the West Bank, your solidarity is felt,” Ramadan said. “You have helped keep alive our belief that justice will prevail.” The Palestinian envoy concluded his message with prayers for Bangladesh’s peace and prosperity, affirming that “Palestine and its people will remain loyal to you, no matter how long it takes.”",amarch gaza ralli dhaka will write histori palestinian envoi,express deep gratitud peopl bangladesh palestinian ambassador bangladesh yousef ramadan say amarch gaza ralli dhaka will write page histori call ralli on power displai solidar palestin recent memori statement issu saturdai ambassador yousef ramadan hail saturdai mass ralli dhaka dub march gaza histor declar support will echo across border gener thousand peopl includ student imam artist civil societi member gather suhrawardi udyan dhaka april 12 wave palestinian bangladeshi flag show uniti ralli demand end isra occup justic palestinian dhaka continu surpris world unparallel sincer say ambassador bangladesh choose grant palestinian peopl renew strength encourag moral immun continu struggl freedom independ describ bangladesh stanc irrevers decis remain right side histori stand palestin without compromis nativeclick ad statement pay tribut peopl take part ralli thank everi student march everi artist paint everi imam prai call brother sister hope digniti struggl refuge camp gaza oliv grove west bank solidar feel ramadan say help keep aliv belief justic will prevail palestinian envoi conclud messag prayer bangladesh peac prosper affirm palestin peopl will remain loyal matter long take,express deep gratitud peopl bangladesh palestinian ambassador bangladesh yousef ramadan say amarch gaza ralli dhaka will write page histori call ralli on power displai solidar palestin recent memori statement issu saturdai ambassador yousef ramadan hail saturdai mass ralli dhaka dub march gaza histor declar support will echo across border gener thousand peopl includ student imam artist civil societi member gather suhrawardi udyan dhaka april 12 wave palestinian bangladeshi flag show uniti ralli demand end isra occup justic palestinian dhaka continu surpris world unparallel sincer say ambassador bangladesh choose grant palestinian peopl renew strength encourag moral immun continu struggl freedom independ describ bangladesh stanc irrevers decis remain right side histori stand palestin without compromis nativeclick ad statement pay tribut peopl take part ralli thank everi student march everi artist paint everi imam prai call brother sister hope digniti struggl refuge camp gaza oliv grove west bank solidar feel ramadan say help keep aliv belief justic will prevail palestinian envoi conclud messag prayer bangladesh peac prosper affirm palestin peopl will remain loyal matter long take,8,peopl_student_univers_gaza,0.031914893617021274,0.03723404255319149,0.0425531914893617,0.18617021276595744,0.0797872340425532,0.06382978723404255,0.17553191489361702,0.2553191489361702,0.06914893617021277,0.05851063829787234
science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111632,"US, Iran hold ‘constructive’ talks over nuclear deal",2025-04-13,"Iran and the US have concluded a first round of talks in Oman over Tehran’s nuclear programme - the highest-level meeting between the two nations since 2018, the BBC reported. Both countries described the meeting as “constructive” and confirmed a second round of discussions will take place next week - with the US hailing the “direct communication” as being key to striking a possible deal. President Donald Trump pulled the US out of a previous nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers in 2018, and has long said he would make a “better” deal. The talks are seen as an important first step in establishing whether a deal can be done. At two-and-a-half hours, the first meeting was brief, reportedly respectful - and set the stage for a second round. That was probably as good as it could get when Iranian and US officials sat down in Muscat, the capital of Oman - whose top diplomat mediated the primarily indirect negotiations. They were the most significant talks since Trump pulled the US out of the Iran nuclear deal of 2015 during his first term in office. The verdict of Iran’s lead negotiator, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, was positive. NativeClick Ads “In my opinion, as the first meeting, it was a constructive meeting held in a very peaceful and respectful environment, because no inappropriate language was used,” he told Iranian state TV. His diplomatic tone suggests the US team led by Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff did not reiterate some of the president’s threats that Iran would face “great danger” if this dialogue did not succeed. He has repeatedly warned of possible military strikes. This meeting ran with the delegations in separate rooms, relaying messages through Oman’s foreign minister, Badr bin Hamad al-Busaidi. Witkoff, who is leading the US delegation, had previously only spoken of meeting face-to-face. But Araghchi and Witkoff did speak for a few minutes in the presence of Busaidi – not the direct talks US officials said would happen but what could be a small but significant opening. Iran, mindful of pressure from hardliners at home, underlined how limited their face-to-face exchange was, with no photographs taken. In a statement following the talks, the White House said the discussions “were very positive and constructive”, noting that Witkoff had emphasised to Iran that he had instructions to resolve the adversaries’ “differences through dialogue and diplomacy, if that is possible”. “These issues are very complicated, and special envoy Witkoff’s direct communication today was a step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome,” the statement added. Araghchi had said ahead of the discussions that his country wanted a “fair agreement”. After the talks concluded, he said discussions next week may not happen in Oman, but would still be mediated by the Middle Eastern nation. The White House said they would take place next Saturday. “Neither we, nor the other party, want fruitless negotiations, discussions for discussions’ sake, time wasting or talks that drag on forever,” Araghchi told Iranian state television.",unit state iran hold construct talk nuclear deal,iran unit state conclud first round talk oman tehran nuclear programm highestlevel meet two nation sinc 2018 bbc report countri describ meet construct confirm 2 round discuss will take place next week unit state hail direct commun kei strike possibl deal presid donald trump pull unit state previou nuclear agreement iran world power 2018 long say make good deal talk see import first step establish whether deal can do twoandahalf hour first meet brief reportedli respect set stage 2 round probabl good get iranian unit state offici sit muscat capit oman whose top diplomat mediat primarili indirect negoti signific talk sinc trump pull unit state iran nuclear deal 2015 first term offic verdict iran lead negoti foreign minist abba araghchi posit nativeclick ad opinion first meet construct meet hold peac respect environ inappropri languag us tell iranian state tv diplomat tone suggest unit state team lead trump envoi steve witkoff reiter presid threat iran face great danger dialogu succe repeatedli warn possibl militari strike meet run deleg separ room relai messag oman foreign minist badr bin hamad awami leaguebusaidi witkoff lead unit state deleg previous speak meet facetofac araghchi witkoff speak minut presenc busaidi direct talk unit state offici say happen small signific open iran mind pressur hardlin home underlin limit facetofac exchang photograph take statement follow talk white hous say discuss posit construct note witkoff emphasis iran instruct resolv adversari differ dialogu diplomaci possibl issu complic special envoi witkoff direct commun todai step forward achiev mutual benefici outcom statement ad araghchi say ahead discuss countri want fair agreement talk conclud say discuss next week mai happen oman still mediat middl eastern nation white hous say take place next saturdai neither parti want fruitless negoti discuss discuss sake time wast talk drag forev araghchi tell iranian state televis,iran unit state conclud first round talk oman tehran nuclear programm highestlevel meet two nation sinc 2018 bbc report countri describ meet construct confirm 2 round discuss will take place next week unit state hail direct commun kei strike possibl deal presid donald trump pull unit state previou nuclear agreement iran world power 2018 long say make good deal talk see import first step establish whether deal can do twoandahalf hour first meet brief reportedli respect set stage 2 round probabl good get iranian unit state offici sit muscat capit oman whose top diplomat mediat primarili indirect negoti signific talk sinc trump pull unit state iran nuclear deal 2015 first term offic verdict iran lead negoti foreign minist abba araghchi posit nativeclick ad opinion first meet construct meet hold peac respect environ inappropri languag us tell iranian state tv diplomat tone suggest unit state team lead trump envoi steve witkoff reiter presid threat iran face great danger dialogu succe repeatedli warn possibl militari strike meet run deleg separ room relai messag oman foreign minist badr bin hamad awami leaguebusaidi witkoff lead unit state deleg previous speak meet facetofac araghchi witkoff speak minut presenc busaidi direct talk unit state offici say happen small signific open iran mind pressur hardlin home underlin limit facetofac exchang photograph take statement follow talk white hous say discuss posit construct note witkoff emphasis iran instruct resolv adversari differ dialogu diplomaci possibl issu complic special envoi witkoff direct commun todai step forward achiev mutual benefici outcom statement ad araghchi say ahead discuss countri want fair agreement talk conclud say discuss next week mai happen oman still mediat middl eastern nation white hous say take place next saturdai neither parti want fruitless negoti discuss discuss sake time wast talk drag forev araghchi tell iranian state televis,1,state_unit_say_trump,0.46853146853146854,0.024475524475524476,0.05944055944055944,0.1258741258741259,0.05944055944055944,0.03146853146853147,0.045454545454545456,0.04895104895104895,0.0979020979020979,0.038461538461538464

In a notice, US Customs and Border Patrol said that the goods would be excluded from Trump’s 10% global tariff on most countries and the much larger Chinese import tax. It marks the first significant reprieve of any kind in Trump’s tariffs on China, with one trade analyst describing it as a “game-changer scenario”. Late on Saturday, while travelling to Miami, Trump said he would give more details of the exemptions at the start of next week. “We’ll be very specific,” he told reporters on Air Force One. ""But we're taking in a lot of money. As a country we're taking in a lot of money."" The move came after concerns from US tech companies that the price of gadgets could skyrocket, as many of them are made in China.

The White House indicated the exemptions were made to ensure companies had more time to move production to the US. ""President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops,"" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. ""At the direction of the president, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible."" Trump, who is spending the weekend at his Florida home, told reporters on Friday he was comfortable with the high tariffs on China. ""And I think something positive is going to come out of that,"" he said, touting his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping. These electronic goods are still subject to the 20% tariff on China related to fentanyl, White House Deputy Chief of Staff on Policy Stephen Miller posted on X. Some estimates suggested iPhone prices in the US could have as much as tripled if costs were passed on to consumers. The US is a major market for iPhones, while Apple accounted for more than half of its smartphones sales last year, according to Counterpoint Research. It says as much as 80% of Apple's iPhones intended for US sale are made in China, with the remaining 20% made in India. Like its fellow smartphone giant Samsung, Apple has been trying to diversify its supply chains to avoid an over-reliance on China in recent years. India and Vietnam emerged as frontrunners for additional manufacturing hubs. As the tariffs took effect, Apple reportedly looked to speed up and increase its production of India-produced devices in recent days. Trump had planned for a host of steep tariffs on countries around the world to take effect this week. But on Wednesday he announced he would implement a 90-day pause for countries hit by higher US tariffs - except China, whose tariffs he raised to 145%. Trump said the tariff increase for China was because of the country's readiness to retaliate with its own 84% levy on US goods. In a dramatic change of policy, Trump said all countries that had not retaliated against US tariffs would receive the reprieve – and only face a blanket tariff of 10% – until July. The White House then said the move was a negotiating tactic to extract more favourable trade terms from other countries. Trump has said his import taxes will address unfairness in the global trading system, as well as bring jobs and factories back to the US.",trump exempt smartphon comput new tariff,unit state presid

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy demanded a tough international response against Moscow over the attack, which came with U.S. President Donald Trump's push to rapidly end the war struggling to make a breakthrough. Dead bodies were strewn on the ground in the middle of a city street near a destroyed bus and burnt-out cars in a video posted by Zelenskiy on social media. ""Only scoundrels can act like this. Taking the lives of ordinary people,"" he said, noting that the attack had come on Palm Sunday when some people were going to church. Russian authorities did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. It followed a missile strike in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih, Zelenskiy's hometown and far from the ground war's front lines in the east and south, earlier this month that killed 20 people, including nine children. Sumy, with a population of around a quarter of a million and located just over 25 km (15 miles) from the Russian border, became a garrison city when Kyiv's forces launched an incursion into Russia last August that has since been largely repelled.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111648,"Preventing global warm, carbon offset could be worthy alternative",2025-04-13,"Carbon credits are one of the major pillars of most of the country's climate change strategy. Though many experts stated that, depending on offsets to meet emission reduction goals are mathematically impossible and a recipe for climate disaster. However, it serves as one of the most effective tools in the face of climate change. Since the Industrial Revolution, humanity has emitted over two thousand gigatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The heat-trapping greenhouse gases have created a layer in the atmosphere, resulting in global warming. If we do not reduce global warming, the adverse effects of climate change—such as wildfires, heat waves, rising sea levels, floods, and droughts—will continue to escalate. To combat climate change, it is essential to rapidly prevent the emission of greenhouse gases. This includes increasing the use of renewable energy and halting deforestation. Controlling highly polluting gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide is crucial. However, these efforts alone are not sufficient to halt climate change. Scientists have stated that global temperatures must be kept below 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius, which is necessary to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. We need not only to reduce carbon emissions but also to remove and store some carbon from the atmosphere. In fact, most climate models suggest that by 2050, we need to remove hundreds of millions of metric tons of carbon dioxide annually while also accelerating the pace of carbon reduction. The 'carbon offset' method plays a vital role as an effective and natural way to remove carbon from the atmosphere. In this method, those who emit carbon in the atmosphere will fund others to remove that carbon as compensation. They will sequester carbon in the soil by planting or cultivating trees in regenerative practices or by using specific technologies. Carbon-emitting groups will finance the carbon-removing groups. How Carbon Offsetting Can Be Achieved First, by capturing and destroying greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere, such as methane gas capture projects at landfills. Second, by utilizing clean and renewable energy. This serves as an alternative to the greenhouse gases released from the use of natural gas. Third, through regenerative agricultural practices. This establishes a conservation and restoration process for food production, enhancing soil fertility, making the soil arable again, improving water flow quality, increasing biodiversity, and preventing soil erosion. Such agricultural systems can sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide in the form of carbon in the soil, which also contributes to soil fertility. In other words, carbon offsetting is achieved through carbon sequestration using this method. Fourth, another way to introduce carbon into the soil is through biochar. This is a type of charcoal made by burning organic matter such as crop residues, grass, trees, or other plants at temperatures of 300 to 600 degrees Celsius in the absence of oxygen. This process, known as pyrolysis, can prevent the loss of carbon from organic matter. Biochar is a stable form of carbon that cannot easily escape into the atmosphere. By preserving carbon in the soil, biochar increases soil fertility and reduces the need for chemical fertilizers. Fifth, certain minerals naturally react with carbon dioxide, transforming it from a gas into a solid substance. This process is commonly referred to as carbon mineralization. Naturally, this occurs very slowly, taking hundreds or thousands of years. However, scientists are discovering methods to accelerate the carbon mineralization process. In this method, carbon dioxide is introduced into suitable rocks or minerals, where it reacts to turn gaseous carbon dioxide into solid carbonate. Sixth, the use of carbon capture technology, or KMCIDR. This technology has been developed for capturing carbon dioxide from heavy industrial factories. Industries and power generation plants that burn hydrocarbons to produce electricity can utilize this technology. This method can capture up to 90 percent of carbon dioxide from flue gases emitted by power plants. This technology has the capacity to capture 300 kilograms of carbon dioxide per day, totaling nearly 116 million tons annually. Bangladesh has begun the journey Bangladesh has begun participating in carbon offsetting, primarily through initiatives like the Solar Home System, which have generated significant carbon credits. These credits are traded on international markets, providing financial incentives for reducing emissions. Bangladesh also has a target of reducing carbon emissions by 22% by 2030 and aims to source 30% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030 and 40% by 2041. Limitations regarding Carbon offsetting Despite being a useful tool, carbon offsetting has drawbacks. It should not be used in place of direct emission reductions because doing so alone may cause operational improvements to be delayed and high-emission activities to continue. The caliber and legitimacy of offset initiatives are other issues some may not produce the savings that were promised or may have unfavorable effects. Measuring and confirming emissions, guaranteeing the stability of carbon sequestration, and avoiding greenwashing are other difficulties. However, along with other preventive measures, countries should plan for this approach. Some countries in South Asia, including Bangladesh and India, and many countries in Europe have already taken plans and activities in this regard. Bangladesh also aims to reduce carbon emissions. Global leaders have reached a consensus to decrease greenhouse gas emissions to make the world more livable, aiming for net-zero carbon pollution by 2050. Bangladesh is joining this initiative. The government has implemented various plans and measures to reduce carbon emissions. Like many others, Bangladesh wants to move away from fossil fuel usage. Recently, the government has shut down several coal-fired power plants while keeping the ongoing ones operational. According to sources in the Power Division, no new coal-fired power plants will be constructed beyond the existing ones at Payra, Rampal, and Matarbari. This decision has led to the cancellation of at least two mega projects in Payra, one in Rampal, and three in Matarbari, along with one project each in Khulna, Munshiganj and Chattogram. NativeClick Ads When asked about the gains and losses from this decision, an official from the Power Division stated that there will be less coal burned. The demand for electricity will inevitably arise, and the government plans to meet that demand by utilizing clean fuels. As a result, carbon emissions will decrease. The government is placing emphasis on renewable energy. Brick kilns are significant contributors to environmental pollution, as they burn wood to produce bricks. This not only leads to carbon emissions but also increases pollution due to the removal of topsoil. The government states that alongside auto brick kilns, blocks will be produced to meet demand. Some factories for producing hollow blocks have already been established in the country. Experts estimate that using blocks will reduce construction costs by 30%. Additionally, homes built with blocks remain cool in the summer and warm in the winter, which will also lessen cooling and heating loads. There are approximately 8,000 brick kilns in the country, with 1,789 located in and around Dhaka. Dhaka alone has 487 brick kilns, which contribute nearly 58% to the city's pollution. Meanwhile, the government is also looking to produce energy-efficient appliances. The Sustainable Renewable Energy Authority has already begun working on star labeling. The aim of this project is to encourage the use of energy-efficient devices. In this context, Dr. Syeda Rizwana Hasan, an adviser to the interim government of Bangladesh, stated, we have taken several initiatives for carbon control. We are prioritizing renewable energy. Work is ongoing to modernize brick kilns, and we have also initiated measures to control vehicle pollution. What Experts Are Saying Climate scientist Dr. Abed Chowdhury states that removing carbon from the atmosphere and storing it in the soil is a crucial part of carbon offsetting. By measuring the amount of organic matter in the soil both before and after carbon storage, it is possible to determine how much carbon has been removed or retained. Based on the extent of carbon removal and retention, compensation can be sought from companies responsible for greenhouse gas emissions. He further explains that agriculture-dependent countries like Bangladesh can earn a certain amount of money by participating in carbon offsetting. They can even choose carbon offsetting as a means of livelihood. We believe there is nothing impossible for humanity. Those who once emerged from the interiors of Africa and conquered the world will now find a way to navigate through this crisis of global warming. Professor Dr. Zillur Rahman, director of the Disaster Science and Climate Resilience Department at Dhaka University, says that if we want to avoid negative impacts, we must adopt certain measures. In this case, reducing carbon emissions should be the primary focus. It is not enough to simply plant trees we must also decrease our reliance on oil, gas, and other fossil fuels that release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Industries need to establish environmentally sensitive frameworks. In developed countries, a carbon footprint assessment is conducted before any institution or building is constructed. Although we have building codes here, the issue of carbon footprint has not yet been addressed. Dr. Zillur Rahman adds that while green technology may be expensive, its implementation can be initiated in our country. Although it may involve substantial costs now, we will reap the benefits in the long run. When we are able to reduce the temperature spikes in the atmosphere, the entire world will adopt us as a model.

On the occasion of the Bangla New Year, various programmes are being organised at public venues in the capital and elsewhere across the country. Entities under the ministry of cultural affairs and various cultural and social organisations and educational institutions have taken preparations to celebrate the day amid heightened security measures on the occasion. The day begins with Chhayanaut’s traditional cultural event at the Ramna Park while Dhaka University will bring out the main traditional New Year procession from its campus, which has recently been renamed Barshabaran Ananda Shobhajatra in place of Mangal Shobhajatra celebrated from 1989. The DU authorities said they have brought back the original name to make the celebrations more inclusive. The original title of the procession was Ananda Shobhajatra. Chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus on Sunday in a statement greeted the country’s people on the occasion of Pahela Baishakh. In his statement, he said that Pahela Baishakh is one of the symbols of harmony. NativeClick Ads ‘The Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, Christians, various communities and the peoples of the hills and plains of this country -- all together, the people of this country have diverse languages, cultures and traditions,’ said Professor Yunus. Cultural organisation Chhayanaut organises the Pahela Baishakh celebration programme at the Ramna Green, the biggest event organised every year since 1967 to celebrate the Bengali New Year. The Chhayanaut programme began at 6:15am to the playing of the Ahir Bhairab raga.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111656,Need for ADR in Bangladesh,2025-04-14,"Introduction: The term ‘ADR’ simply means Alternative Dispute Resolution, which refers to other methods that are available to resolve a dispute, apart from court proceedings these ADR methods involve arbitration, mediation, negotiation, etc. In today’s world, day by day, ADR is gaining widespread significance. However, people residing in Bangladesh still today, despite the enactment of the Arbitration Act 2001, do not properly comprehend the idea of ADR. Although slowly the justice system of Bangladesh will fully integrate ADR and people will have sufficient knowledge about it, the enactment of the Arbitration Act 2001 was one of the first steps, and mediation can be traced in the Family Courts Ordinance of 1985. Benefits of ADR: Before implementing ADR services or advocating the increased significance of ADR in Bangladesh, its benefits must be assessed. To begin with, ADR is cost-friendly this is because lower legal fees are associated with ADR methods. Also, since parties avoid court litigation, a huge sum of money is being saved, and usually parties going for ADR fully settle their issues, so there is no chance of appeal like in the court litigation scenarios, hence saving further costs. ADR services like mediation, arbitration, and negotiation are very time-friendly compared to litigation since a settlement can be reached quickly, also because of a smaller number of procedural delays, and these methods also provide flexibility. ADR maintains confidentiality and privacy, providing protection to secret and sensitive information of the parties for example, if a large business implements ADR like arbitration, their trade secrets will be protected as a result, and both their corporate and personal reputations are safeguarded. Unlike the hectic procedure of court litigation, ADR services provide a more relaxed environment for the parties that ensures emotional well-being. Moreover, when a party goes through court litigation, the ruling of the court can be damaging for one party however, ADR is focused on a win-win situation for both parties when resolving a dispute, causing minimal damage to both parties and saving their reputation in the long run. ADR also reduces the excess number of cases that go for litigation, which reduces the pressure from court, as unwanted or a huge number of cases can be solved through ADR. Why ADR is not implemented in Bangladesh: It is important to examine the people’s lack of knowledge when it comes to ADR in Bangladesh only a few businesses, certain legal professionals, and a few institutions know about ADR, but in general, people only run after court litigation. A lot of people in Bangladesh are unaware of the operations and functions of their country’s legal field hence, the concept of ADR is alien to them. Despite acknowledgement of ADR in Bangladesh via the Arbitration Act 2001 and the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act 2003, ADR still lacks institutional promotion, as it is visible that citizens do not know about any well-established ADR centres, which restricts the implementation of ADR services like arbitration and mediation also, no initiatives on such establishments are taken, for example, the Bangladesh International Arbitration Centre (BIAC) is not known by many and underutilised, although established in 2011. Another issue is that the litigants of Bangladesh do not communicate with clients about ADR this is because a lot of the lawyers themselves do not know about the advantages of ADR or do not fully understand the potential of ADR or do not talk about it openly due to lack of incentives, resulting in further slow popularity of ADR, making the court litigation busier with unwanted cases. Another issue that may be seen is that people do not trust ADR services compared to litigation this emerged probably because of the lack of knowledge they have about ADR, and so they do not want to explore ADR like arbitration or mediation and risk their complaints. Moreover, some enforcement issues can be seen as well, despite Arbitration’s arbitral award being acknowledged in the Arbitration Act 2001 the provisions that are found in the Arbitration Act 2001 and the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act 2003 lack appropriate enforcement, as there is no proper body in Bangladesh that maintains proper regulations of ADR services, decreasing the efficiency of such services and leading towards persistent delay. Solution and Why ADR Will Help Bangladesh: Fortunately, regardless of all these problems, it is still possible to make ADR popular in Bangladesh. First of all, a way should be figured out to promote ADR through court for this, the UK’s pre-action protocol, which is followed in civil claims, or something similar to the pre-action protocol, can be introduced. So basically, in the UK, before commencing litigation, both parties have to follow the pre-action protocol, and in this pre-action, courts highly recommend ADR, like arbitration, and if a party skips ADR unnecessarily, they get penalised by the court later. If something similar to this is introduced, the knowledge of ordinary people of Bangladesh about ADR will increase. If successfully, ADR is promoted in front of the general public of Bangladesh, ADR centres like BIAC will not be underutilised anymore, as they will be used more, leading to the government making investments for ADR centres or even expanding ADR centres from major cities to rural areas. This simple method will make the public of Bangladesh explore ADR, which will make them more aware of the system of ADR, and once they explore it, chances are they may like the system due to the benefits it offers thus, their trust in ADR will also increase. Moreover, the issue of lack of knowledge of lawyers can easily be countered by the Bangladesh Bar Council they can create a training certification program for lawyers on ADR, and they can also integrate a topic of ADR in bar examinations. For the new generation of lawyers, a subject of ADR can be added to their LLB program in universities of Bangladesh, like in India, where ADR has been added as a subject in the undergraduate program under many law schools and universities. A system of performance-based fees can be introduced for ADR so that lawyers do not think ADR is not worthy and advise the clients about it. If this is done successfully, it will mean lawyers will be trained in the field of ADR, so whenever one corporation goes into a contract with another corporation, of course they seek a lawyer’s advice, and since the lawyers of the new generation hold knowledge of ADR, they are likely to advise their clients to add an ADR clause to the contract, thus further promoting the system. NativeClick Ads Furthermore, the enforcement issue of ADR can be dealt with easily. This can be done by establishing a strong regulatory body for ADR in Bangladesh. Further, stronger rules and regulations can be developed, which can be done by strengthening ADR guidelines that can be maintained by the strong regulatory body for ADR this body can also ensure and improve transparency in arbitration. Even backup from court can be used for enforcement of arbitral awards, which is clearly mentioned in the statutory provision of the Arbitration Act 2001. This will mean court-annexed ADR, which is already available in Bangladesh through the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act 2003. Additionally, in order to bring more innovation and development in the system of ADR, all the nations that are implementing ADR or countries where the significance of ADR is increasing slowly can build a forum where ADR specialists from different countries can share their own experiences and ideas in order to promote ADR further and enhance the ADR services more this is highly beneficial since there is a growth of international commerce and businesses that usually go for ADR services like arbitration due to global enforceability, for being both time- and cost-friendly. In Bangladesh, there is an excess number of cases in court litigation as about 4.2 million lawsuits are pending in the courts, pressurizing the courts with a lot of cases due to the absence of appropriate ADR services as a result, many cases are pending for a long time. William Gladstone mentions, “Justice delayed is justice denied,” which has been the scene in Bangladesh’s judiciary because of the large number of cases justice is not being served in a timely manner, and justice is costly, so this is the time to give ADR an active role in Bangladesh. In Italy during 2010-2011 had a similar issue like in Bangladesh, at this time the number of cases that has been pending in the Italian courts rose to 5.4 million, for which mediation was made mandatory through Decree 28/2010, despite this facing resistance at first mandatory mediation obtained success as tens of thousands of cases was mediated since March 2011. Making mediation mandatory is not suggested, but if ADR can make a huge change in Italy, then Bangladesh should implement it to sustain a better legal system to make it better and relieve the pressure on it. Another example would be Canada, where ADR grew in the 1980s and 1990s and soon became effective. Canada’s Supreme Court in Hryniak v Mauldin mentions the rule of law can be upheld through proper access to justice and acknowledges the new adjudication methods. If implementing ADR helps countries like Canada and Italy to decrease pressure from courts and improves the quality of justice, then enhancing the legal framework of ADR will also benefit Bangladesh. Lastly, applying ADR in Bangladesh also upholds the constitution of Bangladesh. The preamble of the constitution of Bangladesh believes in the rule of law and access to justice for all the citizens, aligning with ADR services goals. Moreover, Article 27 of Bangladesh’s constitution ensures equality before the law, and Article 35 mentions, in respect of trial and punishment, both can be safeguarded via ADR methods. Conclusion: Peacemaker Kenneth Cloke, founder of Mediation Beyond Borders International, indicates that without disorder, no new world is created likewise, the legal system of Bangladesh has already gone through a lot of issues now it is time to heal it by proper integration of ADR, securing the future.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111657,Nobel laureate Mario Vargas Llosa dies,2025-04-14,"Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa passed away on Sunday (April 14), aged 89. The Nobel laureate died in Peru’s capital Lima surrounded by his family and “at peace,” his son Alvaro Vargas Llosa, a well-known political commentator, said on X. Rumors of the writer’s deteriorating health had spread in recent months, during which he had been living out of the public eye. Vargas Llosa was a leading figure in Latin America's1960s literary scene. He continued to write novels and essays for decades, with his works being translated into many languages. Vargas Llosa was granted honorary doctorates, prizes and awards worldwide throughout his lifetime. The most prestigious award was undoubtedly the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2010, which the Swedish Academy awarded him for ""his cartography of the structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual's resistance, revolt and defeat."" ""We would be worse than we are without the good books we have read, more conformist, not as restless, more submissive, and the critical spirit, the engine of progress, would not even exist. Like writing, reading is a protest against the insufficiencies of life,"" said Vargas Llosa in his acceptance speech at the Swedish Academy in Stockholm on December 7, 2010. ""Good literature erects bridges between different peoples, and by having us enjoy, suffer, or feel surprise, unites us beneath the languages, beliefs, habits, customs, and prejudices that separate us,"" he added. In 2016, he became the first living Spanish-speaking writer to be included in France's Bibliotheque de la Pleiade, a venerable collection of universal classics translated into French, and he was elected a member of the prestigious Academie Francaise in 2021. NativeClick Ads Born Jorge Mario Pedro Vargas Llosa to a middle-class family on March 28, 1936 in Arequipa, Peru, he spent the early years of his childhood in Bolivia before returning to his native country. As a teenager, he attended a military academy in Lima, and soon started working as a local journalist. A student of law and literature, Vargas Llosa started to write short stories first published in the late 1950s. He moved to Paris in 1959, and lived there for several years._Agencies",nobel laureat mario varga llosa di,peruvian writer mario varga llosa pass awai sundai ag 89 nobel laureat di peru capit lima surround famili peac son alvaro varga llosa wellknown polit comment say x rumor writer deterior health spread recent month live public ey varga llosa lead figur latin america is1960 literari scene continu write novel essai decad work translat mani languag varga llosa grant honorari doctor prize award worldwid throughout lifetim prestigi award undoubtedli nobel prize literatur 2010 swedish academi award cartographi structur power trenchant imag individu resist revolt defeat wors without good book read conformist restless submiss critic spirit engin progress even exist like write read protest insuffici life say varga llosa accept speech swedish academi stockholm decemb 7 2010 good literatur erect bridg differ peopl u enjoi suffer feel surpris unit u beneath languag belief habit custom prejudic separ u ad 2016 becam first live spanishspeak writer includ franc bibliothequ de la pleiad vener collect univers classic translat french elect member prestigi academi francais 2021 nativeclick ad bear jorg mario pedro varga llosa middleclass famili march 28 1936 arequipa peru spend earli year childhood bolivia return nativ countri teenag attend militari academi lima soon start work local journalist student law literatur varga llosa start write short stori first publish late 1950 move pari 1959 live sever yearsag,peruvian writer mario varga llosa pass awai sundai ag 89 nobel laureat di peru capit lima surround famili peac son alvaro varga llosa wellknown polit comment say x rumor writer deterior health spread recent month live public ey varga llosa lead figur latin america is1960 literari scene continu write novel essai decad work translat mani languag varga llosa grant honorari doctor prize award worldwid throughout lifetim prestigi award undoubtedli nobel prize literatur 2010 swedish academi award cartographi structur power trenchant imag individu resist revolt defeat wors without good book read conformist restless submiss critic spirit engin progress even exist like write read protest insuffici life say varga llosa accept speech swedish academi stockholm decemb 7 2010 good literatur erect bridg differ peopl u enjoi suffer feel surpris unit u beneath languag belief habit custom prejudic separ u ad 2016 becam first live spanishspeak writer includ franc bibliothequ de la pleiad vener collect univers classic translat french elect member prestigi academi francais 2021 nativeclick ad bear jorg mario pedro varga llosa middleclass famili march 28 1936 arequipa peru spend earli year childhood bolivia return nativ countri teenag attend militari academi lima soon start work local journalist student law literatur varga llosa start write short stori first publish late 1950 move pari 1959 live sever yearsag,4,will_dai_year_time,0.11949685534591195,0.09433962264150944,0.11949685534591195,0.1761006289308176,0.06918238993710692,0.06918238993710692,0.12578616352201258,0.07547169811320754,0.050314465408805034,0.10062893081761007
science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111658,Ananda Shubhajatra not brought out from political view: Farooki,2025-04-14,"Cultural Affairs Adviser Mostofa Sarwar Farooki has said that this year’s Barshobaran Ananda Shubhajatra is not a political program and it has not been brought out from the political view. “Fascism is not part of politics. Barshobaran Ananda Shubhajatra is not political program . . . this year we used mask of fascists for not the purpose of politics”, he said. The adviser said this while inaugurating the Noboborsho Ananda Shobhajatra-1432 on the Dhaka University campus on Monday. The adviser said, “Previously, a particular political group used this cultural Shobhajatra at Dhaka University as a tool to defeat their political opponents.” “However, there are some historical political ingredients in this year's Noboborsho observation including the traditions of the Akbar era and the traditions of the Sultanate era but there is nothing typical politics here,” Farooki said. Commenting on the renaming of the procession, he said Ananda Shobhajatra was started in the Fine Arts faculty in 1989. Later in 1996, it was changed to Mangal Shobhajatra. This time the authorities reinstated again to ‘Borshoborn Ananda Shobhajatra’, adding, “There was no incident of imposition, it was imposed earlier. The name was Borshoboron Shobhajatra in Jessore. When it came to Dhaka, it was named Ananda Shobhajatra. Afterwards, Mangal Shobhajatra was imposed”. “This time, Fine Arts has decided to get back to the name with which the observation was started here,” he added.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111669,Ex-Malaysia PM Abdullah dies,2025-04-15,"Former Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi passed away on Monday (April 14), aged 85, Reuters reported quoting his family and medical authorities. The former premier died at 7:10 pm (1110 GMT) at the National Heart Institute in the capital Kuala Lumpur, his son-in-law and former health minister Khairy Jamaluddin said in an Instagram post, without specifying a cause of death. Abdullah was admitted to the National Heart Institute on Sunday after experiencing breathing difficulties and was immediately placed under intensive care, the institute said in a statement. “Despite all medical efforts, he passed away peacefully, surrounded by his loved ones,” the institute said. Abdullah became Malaysia’s fifth prime minister in 2003, following the resignation of veteran leader Mahathir Mohamad after 22 years at the helm. As premier of the Muslim-majority country, Abdullah embarked on an anti-corruption drive and espoused a moderate version of Islam that aimed for economic and technological progress over religious fundamentalism. But he came under public criticism for his review of fuel subsidies that saw a sharp spike in prices. Abdullah stepped down in 2009, a year after an election that saw the then-ruling Barisan Nasional coalition lose its parliamentary supermajority for the first time in the country’s history.

A year after President Bola Tinubu came to power promising to end widespread insecurity, attacks in the northwest by armed gangs, often referred to as bandits, have become almost routine, with authorities seemingly powerless to stop them. Dozens of gunmen on motorbikes stormed Yargoje in the Kankara local government area of Katsina state late on Sunday, according to resident Hassan Ya’u. “They shot sporadically at people, claiming the lives of more than 50 (of us), including my younger brother,” he told Reuters by phone. He added that an unknown number of villagers had been abducted and properties looted. Another resident, Abdullahi Yunusa Kankara, said he narrowly escaped the onslaught and that it continued into the early hours of Monday. “Our town has turned into a death zone. Almost every house in the village has fallen victim to this attack.” Kankara added: “We are currently carrying out a headcount to determine how many people have been abducted. More dead bodies were recovered this morning.” Katsina police authorities did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Attacks in rural areas and kidnapping for ransom are rife in northern Nigeria, a region blighted by a 15-year-long Islamist insurgency in the northeast and frequent deadly clashes between farmers and herders in north-central areas.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111673,Over 400 killed in paramilitary attacks in Sudan’s Darfur: UN,2025-04-15,"More than 400 people have been killed in recent attacks by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan’s Darfur region, says the UN citing “credible sources”. Last week, the RSF launched an intense ground and aerial assault on refugee camps surrounding the city of El-Fasher in an attempt to seize the last state capital in Darfur held by their rival, the Sudanese army. The two warring sides have been locked in a bloody power struggle since April 2023. This has created the world’s largest humanitarian crisis and forced millions to flee their homes. The UN said it had verified 148 killings between Thursday and Saturday, but warned the toll was much higher. Senior international officials will gather in London later to discuss the ongoing civil war in Sudan on the second anniversary of the start of the conflict. UN spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said their verification process was still ongoing and their number of those killed did not include Sunday’s violence. “Credible sources have reported more than 400 killed,” said Ms Shamdasani. At least nine humanitarian aid workers were among those killed, the UN said. NativeClick Ads The refugee camps that surround El-Fasher - Zamzam and Abu Shouk - provide temporary homes to more than 700,000 people, many of whom are facing famine-like conditions. In a statement released on Saturday, the RSF said it was not responsible for attacks on civilians and that scenes of killing in Zamzam were staged to discredit its forces. The following day, the group said it had completed a “successful liberation” of the camp from Sudan’s army. The RSF accused the army of using Zamzam as “a military barracks, and innocent civilians as human shields”. El-Fasher is the last major town in Darfur under army control and has been under siege by the RSF for a year. Sudan’s brutal civil war will enter its third year on Tuesday. UN Human Rights Chief Volker Türk called on all parties involved to “renew their resolve to take meaningful steps towards resolving the conflict”.

The Republican told reporters that there were ‘millions of people dead because of three people.’ “Let's say Putin number one, but let's say Biden, who had no idea what the hell he was doing, number two, and Zelensky,” Trump said during a meeting with the visiting president of El Salvador.

The one-day conference will bring foreign ministers and leading humanitarian leaders together at a conference in London regarding humanitarian crisis in Sudan. In a statement, the British Foreign Office said that international representatives will discuss how to achieve a peaceful end to the conflict and address the issues preventing aid reaching those most in need. Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary David Lammy will announce new life-saving aid, worth £120 million ($158.4 million) to support over 650,000 Sudanese people. He will also identify steps to improve humanitarian access and find a long-term political solution to the ongoing crisis, added in the statement. Since April 15, 2023, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has been battling the army for control of Sudan, resulting in thousands of deaths and one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. More than 20,000 victims have been killed and 15 million displaced, according to the UN and local authorities. Research from US scholars, however, estimates the death toll at around 130,000. In recent weeks, the RSF has lost significant territory across Sudan to government forces.

Witkoff’s remarks on Tuesday appear to contradict his suggestion a day earlier that the US would be satisfied with Iran enriching uranium at a low level to produce energy. “Any final arrangement must set a framework for peace, stability, and prosperity in the Middle East – meaning that Iran must stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponization program,” Witkoff said in a statement on Tuesday. “It is imperative for the world that we create a tough, fair deal that will endure, and that is what President Trump has asked me to do.” Witkoff’s official title is special envoy to the Middle East, but US President Donald Trump has given him several high-stakes responsibilities beyond the region, including spearheading talks with Russia as well as Iran.

According to internal planning documents of the White House, it wants to eliminate funding, citing failures by operations in Mali, Lebanon and Democratic Republic of Congo. The overall plan wants to slash the State Department budget by about half. The new budget must be approved by Congress, and lawmakers could decide to restore some or all of the funding the administration has proposed cutting. The State Department was due to respond to the OMB proposal on Tuesday. During US President Donald Trump's first term he proposed cutting about a third of diplomacy and aid budgets. But Congress, which sets the federal government budget, pushed back on Trump's proposal. The United Nations peacekeeping budget finances nine missions across various regions, including Mali, Lebanon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, Western Sahara, Cyprus, Kosovo, the area between Syria and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, and Abyei, an administrative region jointly managed by South Sudan and Sudan. The U.S. is the largest financial contributor to the U.N., responsible for 22% of its $3.7 billion core budget and 27% of the $5.6 billion peacekeeping budget, both of which are mandatory contributions.

Director General of South Asia Wing at Bangladesh's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) Ishrat Jahan welcomed her upon arrival at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport. Foreign Secretary Md Jashim Uddin and Pakistan's Foreign Secretary Baloch will lead the Bangladesh and Pakistan sides respectively at the FOC to be held at the state guest house Padma. The two sides are expected to discuss the entire range of bilateral issues, a foreign ministry's official said on Tuesday noting that as no specific agenda has been fixed, all areas of mutual interest are likely to be covered during the discussion. The official said, “After such a long hiatus, it is difficult to prioritize topics in advance, but the talks will be comprehensive.” Bangladesh's High Commissioner to Pakistan, Md Iqbal Hussain Khan, who is currently in Dhaka to attend the meeting, said Islamabad is particularly keen to enhance trade ties with Dhaka. “Pakistan sees potential for boosting exports to Bangladesh, especially if their products are price competitive,” he said. The envoy added that as Pakistan serves as a gateway for goods from Afghanistan and Iran, there is scope for Bangladesh to explore imports via Pakistan, provided transport costs remain low. On the issue of direct air connectivity, High Commissioner Khan said that apart from Fly Jinnah, another Pakistani private carrier, Air Sial-based in Sialkot-has applied to the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) to operate flights to Dhaka. The direct air link is anticipated to boost tourism and promote greater people-to-people contact between the two countries, the envoy noted. When asked about unresolved historical issues between the two nations, the high commissioner said such matters often persist in bilateral relations worldwide, but those should not hinder current engagement or economic cooperation. During her stay in Dhaka, Foreign Secretary Baloch is expected to pay courtesy calls on Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus and Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain following the FOC on Thursday.

Previously, this expensive test had to be done in India or other countries. With the initiative and dedication of the National Institute of Neurosciences and Hospital, along with the support of 'Cure SMA Bangladesh' the only organization in the country working on this condition, this significant achievement has been made possible. The National Institute of Laboratory Medicine and Referral Center provided technical assistance for the test.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111708,"BNP writes letter to CA, what letter says",2025-04-16,"Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir has written a long letter to Chief Adviser Dr. Muhammad Yunus on behalf of the party regarding the prevailing situation in the country. BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir handed over the letter to the chief adviser at the State Guest House Jamuna on Wednesday afternoon. In the letter titled ‘Opinions and suggestions on some urgent matters to be done in the prevailing situation in the country’, BNP has mentioned the end of the Awami League rule and the ouster of the rulers through mass uprising in July-August 2024. In the letter, BNP mentioned that in the long 16-year struggle, more than 1700 opposition leaders and activists have been victims of enforced disappearances, more than a thousand have been killed, and more than 6 million leaders and activists have been injured, maimed, and harassed in cases of disappearance. In addition, more than two thousand youths, students, workers, and women and children have sacrificed their lives in the mass uprising of July-August 2024, and thousands more have been injured and maimed. The letter says that starting from the Great Liberation War, BNP has always worked for the welfare of the people as a leader or active partner in every struggle to restore democracy and human rights. To that end, BNP has supported the interim government led by Prof Yunus in taking over the governance of the state in accordance with the constitution to deliver the benefits of the July-August 2024 students-workers-people uprising to the countrymen and create a sustainable platform to fulfill their aspirations, and has assured full cooperation and continued cooperation. BNP expressed the hope that the people's long-standing expectation from Prof Yunus and the interim government led by him is to quickly bring the fascist party, their party government and associates under the law, prosecute crimes against the people and humanity, prosecute corruption and looting, and return the laundered money, ensure compensation and proper medical treatment for the dead and injured, contain commodity prices and improve law and order, and return state power to the people through a free, fair and impartial national parliamentary election. BNP believes that changes and reforms in the constitution, laws, rules and institutions are essential for holding a free and impartial election. In this regard, they will support any initiative of the government. NativeClick Ads In the letter, BNP termed both the theories of ‘development first, democracy later’ and ‘reform first, democracy later’ as wrong. They believe that development for all is possible only by strengthening and implementing the democratic system and for this, reforms in the state system, laws and policies are necessary. BNP claims that almost all the epoch-making reforms in the history of the country’s politics and economy have come from their hands. They mentioned the 19-point reform programme of Shaheed President Ziaur Rahman, the Vision-2030 of the country’s leader Begum Khaleda Zia and the 27-point reform programme of acting chairman Tarique Rahman for repairing the state structure and the 31-point reform programme announced with the opinions of other parties. BNP said that the ongoing process of reform is part of their declaration and they welcome any ‘reasonable discussion’. However, they do not support the strategy of depriving the people of their voting rights by wasting time for the interests of parties or groups concerned. BNP had earlier conveyed some of its concerns and suggestions to the Chief Adviser on November 21 last year and February 10 this year, but they stated that no discussion was held on those issues. In addition, BNP believes that the government's activities are being hampered by the fact that 764 officials who were discriminated against by the fascist government were promoted but not posted, and demanded their immediate posting. In the letter, BNP emphasized the 'coordination' in the statements of the state's chief executive and the government, and said that the recent 'exceptions' in this have 'worried' them. They want to have confidence in the Chief Adviser, but feel that the statements of some individuals and supporters of his government have created confusion and called for necessary action in this regard. BNP further said that the 'great responsibility' of restoring the democratic rights of the people has been entrusted to the Chief Adviser and they hope that it will be fulfilled as soon as possible. BNP called for an immediate announcement of a specific electoral roadmap with a view to holding the national elections by December. They also proposed to place the NID project under the Election Commission and quickly resolve the legal complications of re-delimitation of constituencies. At the same time, the BNP demanded speedy trial of those involved in the fascist party and their government, compensation and proper treatment for those killed and injured in the July-August uprising, improving the commodity prices and law and order, and withdrawal of false and harassing cases filed during 1/11 and the fascist regime. At the end of the letter, Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir urged the chief adviser to quickly complete the necessary reforms and end the confusion created in the public mind by announcing a specific roadmap for the national elections by next December.",bnp write letter ca letter sai,bangladesh nationalist parti secretari gener mirza fakhrul islam alamgir write long letter chief advis dr muhammad

The list of the most influential persons was published on Wednesday in the website of TIME, a global media brand built on 100 years of unparalleled trust and authority, with an audience of more than 100 million people worldwide. US President Donald Trump, Tesla, SpaceX, and X owner Elon Musk, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Keir Starmer, Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum, Venezuelan Iron Lady María Corina Machado, South Korean leader Lee Jae-myung and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are among other global leaders in the list. After a student-led uprising toppled Bangladesh’s authoritarian prime minister last year, a known leader stepped up to guide the nation toward democracy: Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, TIME says in its web release. Decades earlier, Prof Yunus established the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh to empower the most marginalised communities through small loans, helping millions-97% of them women- build businesses, sustain their families, and reclaim their dignity. “I first met Yunus when he traveled to Arkansas to help the then governor Bill Clinton and me set up similar programmes in the USA. Since then, wherever I’ve traveled in the world, I have witnessed the extraordinary impact of his work- lives transformed, communities lifted, and hope reborn,” said Hillary Rodham Clinton, former US Senator and Secretary of State. “Now, Yunus has answered his country’s call once more. As he shepherds Bangladesh out of the shadows of oppression, he is restoring human rights, demanding accountability and laying the foundations for a just and free society,” she said in the TIME’s release.",prof yunu among time 100 influenti peopl 2025,chief advis professor muhammad yunu take place list time 100 influenti peopl 2025 list influenti person publish wednesdai websit time global medium brand build 100 year unparallel trust author audienc 100 million peopl worldwid unit state presid donald trump tesla spacex x owner elon musk prime minist unit kingdom keir starmer mexico presid claudia sheinbaum venezuelan iron ladi maría corina machado south korean leader lee jaemyung robert f kennedi jr among global leader list studentl upris toppl bangladesh authoritarian prime minist last year know leader step guid nation toward democraci nobel peac prize laureat muhammad yunu time sai web releas decad early prof yunu establish grameen bank bangladesh empow marginalis commun small loan help millions97 woman build busi sustain famili reclaim digniti first meet yunu travel arkansa help governmenternor bill clinton set similar programm unit statesa sinc wherev travel world wit extraordinari impact work live transform commun lift hope reborn say hillari rodham clinton former unit state senat secretari state now yunu answer countri call shepherd bangladesh shadow oppress restor human right demand account lai foundat just free societi say time releas,chief advis professor muhammad yunu take place list time 100 influenti peopl 2025 list influenti person publish wednesdai websit time global medium brand build 100 year unparallel trust author audienc 100 million peopl worldwid unit state presid donald trump tesla spacex x owner elon musk prime minist unit kingdom keir starmer mexico presid claudia sheinbaum venezuelan iron ladi maría corina machado south korean leader lee jaemyung robert f kennedi jr among global leader list studentl upris toppl bangladesh authoritarian prime minist last year know leader step guid nation toward democraci nobel peac prize laureat muhammad yunu time sai web releas decad early prof yunu establish grameen bank bangladesh empow marginalis commun small loan help millions97 woman build busi sustain famili reclaim digniti first meet yunu travel arkansa help governmenternor bill clinton set similar programm unit statesa sinc wherev travel world wit extraordinari impact work live transform commun lift hope reborn say hillari rodham clinton former unit state senat secretari state now yunu answer countri call shepherd bangladesh shadow oppress restor human right demand account lai foundat just free societi say time releas,9,advis_chief_bangladesh_yunu,0.15606936416184972,0.07514450867052024,0.08670520231213873,0.14450867052023122,0.028901734104046242,0.046242774566473986,0.12716763005780346,0.09248554913294797,0.17341040462427745,0.06936416184971098

The commission must be successful in probing this incident. This mystery should be unveiled,” Prof Yunus said when the members of the National Independent Investigation Commission on BDR carnage called on him at the State Guest House Jamuna in the capital on Wednesday. The Commission members met the Chief Adviser to inform him about the progress of its investigation into the barbaric incident. Prof Yunus said the interim government will provide all-out cooperation to the probe commission, saying, “They brutally killed their own officers. This carnage was carried out smoothly.” He noted that the entire nation is looking at the investigation commission and that is why it must reveal the mystery behind this incident. During the meeting, the commission expressed the hope that its probe report would be finalised by June as its investigation is progressing at full speed.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111728,Climate change threatens to destabilize the global economy,2025-04-17,"Climate change is not just an environmental problem it affects financial stability through reduced income and property damage. Climate risk can certainly pose financial risks. But specifics matter and it is important to be clear about its magnitude, likelihood and timeframe. It reduces GDP, weakens economy. It also poses significant risks to financial institutions, leading to increased non-performing loans and reduced profits. Climate-related risks may manifest over varying time horizons, and are likely to intensify over time, especially if the global economy undergoes a disorderly transition. They can drive financial risks, such as credit, market, insurance, and liquidity risks. Economic models vastly underestimate the potential financial loss from climate change and the global economy could face a loss in GDP of at least 50% between 2070 and 2090 if nothing is done to curb emissions, a new report has found. Climate experts say that since the world is urgently trying to curb climate change, it is important to recognize the need for resilience against climate change while maintaining financial stability. The impacts of climate change have already begun to appear in various countries, and nations are taking steps to mitigate and adapt to these effects. Record-breaking heatwaves, devastating floods, and excessive rainfall are pushing global climate change into a dire situation. The environmental destruction caused by chasing economic growth is projected to reduce global income by 19 percent over the next 26 years. Environmental scientists’ research warns that without urgent action, the world could face financial losses ranging from $19 trillion to $59 trillion by 2050. New research from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research reveals that climate change will severely damage the global economy over the next 25 to 26 years. Developed, developing, and underdeveloped countries alike will suffer losses. Income will decline in North America and Europe, while South Asia and Africa will pay a particularly high price, despite their relatively small contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. The report also highlights the severe losses expected in the United States and the European Union. Since the Industrial Revolution, global temperatures have risen by more than 1 degree Celsius due to greenhouse gas emissions. Six years ago, the heads of two central banks issued a stern warning about the financial risks of climate change. Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, and François Villeroy de Galhau, ex-Governor of the Bank of France, issued an open letter sounding the alarm about the global economy. The letter warned that any company or industry failing to adapt to this new world would cease to exist. The letter was signed by the head of the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), a coalition of 34 central banks formed in 2017, of which the Bank of England is a founding member. NativeClick Ads In the letter released on behalf of the Bank of England, Carney and Villeroy de Galhau describe the “catastrophic impacts of climate change.” They note that the effects of climate change are already being felt worldwide, such as heatwaves in North America, storms in Southeast Asia, and droughts in Africa and Australia. These natural disasters are causing extensive damage to infrastructure and personal property, negatively impacting health, reducing productivity, and destroying assets. According to the European Economic Forum, in the coming days, climate change will undermine economic stability worldwide. Recent surveys and studies have expressed this concern. Over the next few decades, economic growth is expected to slow down in most countries around the world. A report by the human rights organization DARA, conducted some time ago on the impact of climate change on the people and economies of 184 countries, stated that by 2030, global economic growth could decline by 3.2 percent of GDP due to climate change. Recent surveys and research from various institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), paint a worrying picture of the economic damage expected from the negative effects of climate change in the coming years. A May 2019 report by The Economic Times warned that countries like the United States will face severe crises due to climate change. Without timely and adequate action, the U.S. economy could suffer losses of at least 10 percent due to its impacts. The report highlighted concerns such as crop failures in the Midwest, devastating wildfires in California, and infrastructure damage in the southern regions. It further noted that if this trend continues, the U.S. economy’s export and supply balance could be disrupted to a degree unseen since the 1980s. In 2018, scientists at Stanford University published a research report on the economic losses caused by climate change. According to their findings, if all countries worldwide manage to limit temperature increases to 2.5 degrees Celsius as per the Paris Climate Agreement, the global GDP would decline by 15 percent. However, if temperatures rise by 3 degrees Celsius, GDP losses could reach 25 percent. If no action is taken, temperatures could increase by 4 degrees Celsius by 2100, resulting in a 30 percent reduction in GDP compared to 2010 levels. The IMF has also expressed concerns that climate change could have a negative impact on the global economy over the next decade. The IMF report highlights that small island nations and coastal countries could lose up to 10 percent of their total economic growth due to climate change. In the context of the Paris Agreement, the IMF has warned of the potential negative effects of climate change on the global economy. According to IMF sources, nearly 80 percent of least developed countries and 50 percent of developing countries are at extreme risk from climate change. In this regard, in addition to Bangladesh, the economies of coastal Cambodia, China, Egypt, Guyana, Suriname, Thailand, and Vietnam will also face significant damage. Furthermore, if temperatures continue to rise, sectors related to agriculture, forestry, coastal housing, and tourism worldwide will suffer extensive harm. Moreover, nearly half of South Asia’s regions face the risk of declining economic growth over the next few decades. The World Bank report states that changes in temperature and rainfall patterns in this region will cause significant economic losses. The World Bank conducted a study assessing the economic impacts of climate change in South Asian countries, including India, and identifying which areas are most vulnerable by 2050. The report reveals that over 800 million people currently live in severe climate hotspots. Among South Asian countries, Bangladeshis living in these critical hotspots will be the most economically affected in terms of per capita GDP due to changes in average weather conditions. It further states that by 2050, their income could decline by 14.4 percent. In comparison, incomes in India and Sri Lanka are projected to decrease by 9.8 percent and 10.1 percent, respectively. According to a World Bank economist, there is a link between climate hotspots and water-scarce areas, putting 600 million Indians at risk of severe water shortages due to climate-related damages. Additionally, changes in the timing and amount of rainfall will adversely affect agricultural production over the next decades. All these factors combined will thrust the region’s economy into a severe crisis. Economic threats in South Asia become acute The primary reason for the economic threats in various South Asian countries lies largely in their dependence on geographic location, infrastructural activities, and natural resources of their economies. This reliance continuously disrupts the process of socio-economic development and economic progress. Although the economies of India and Bangladesh have moved from agriculture to production-oriented industries, a significant portion of their economies is still tied to the agricultural sector. Both countries’ economies remain heavily dependent on agriculture. In Bangladesh, agriculture is the largest employment sector. According to the 2018 economic survey of Bangladesh, it provides 40.6% of the labor force and contributes 14.10% to the national GDP. This sector's role in creating employment, poverty alleviation, human resource development, and food security in the national economy is undeniable. However, climate change is adversely affecting agriculture, the backbone of the country’s economy. Additionally, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), in its report on climate and economics, states that by the end of this century, Bangladesh’s economic growth could face a loss of 9.4%. The report forecasts the financial impact of climate change on six countries, including Bangladesh. Maldives and Nepal are the most vulnerable economically, with anticipated losses of 12.6% and 9.9%, respectively, by the century's end. Bangladesh’s loss is projected at 9.4%, close to Nepal’s figure. India is expected to face an 8.7% economic loss, Bhutan 6.6%, and Sri Lanka 6.5%. The report further notes that to combat climate change, South Asia must spend at least $73 billion annually starting now. Climate change poses a threat not only to the global economy but to all humanity. Despite various initiatives by different countries, global consensus remains elusive. Excessive carbon dioxide has already accumulated in the atmosphere if this is not curbed, what will be our future? However, there is hope as global awareness of climate change is increasing. Some countries are imposing carbon taxes to reduce emissions. China, Denmark, Germany, and Sweden have imposed carbon taxes on the meat, dairy, and poultry industries. Many countries are reducing fossil fuel use and increasing renewable energy consumption. Forest areas are expanding. According to the 2015 agreement, 195 countries have signed pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28% by 2025. Yet, if the earth’s temperature rises by 2 degrees Celsius compared to the pre-industrial era, no further measures will be able to halt climate change. In other words, if we fail to tackle climate change, nearly all countries’ economies will plunge into severe crisis, and ultimately, we will suffer the consequences. Among the sectors directly negatively affected by climate change in Bangladesh’s economy, agriculture stands foremost. Its productivity entirely depends on temperature, rainfall, intensity, weather conditions, and seasonal variations. Key crops include food grains, rice, jute, wheat, tea, and mangoes. Rice is Bangladesh’s main crop. In 2005-06, production was 28.8 million tons. Bangladesh is the world’s fourth-largest rice producer. Despite rice and jute being the main crops, wheat has greater overall importance. However, climate change has adversely impacted this sector. According to agricultural information services, rising temperatures are causing a steady decline in rice production. Rice cultivation requires temperatures between 18–35 degrees Celsius. During winter, temperatures often drop well below 18 degrees, and during summer, they rise above 35 degrees. This causes difficulties in rice pollination and reduces yield. Rising temperatures cause polar ice to melt, increasing sea levels. Soil salinity in coastal agricultural lands is rising, further reducing crop production day by day. Researchers warn that if soil salinity continues to increase, agricultural income will drop by 21% annually, and 40% of coastal farmland will be at risk. This threatens the livelihoods of approximately 240,000 farmers. Besides rice, production of other crops such as jute, wheat, maize, peas, and chickpeas is also declining due to hailstorms, storms, sudden floods, and other extreme weather events. Per capita income is decreasing as a result. Moreover, excessive cold spells in the Rabi season severely damage crop yields. A significant portion of Bangladesh’s economy depends on fishery resources. Employment, foreign exchange, and even the healthcare sector rely heavily on it. Bangladesh has nearly 147,000 hectares of ponds, 5,488 hectares of baor (oxbow lakes), and 11 million hectares of shrimp farms. Additionally, about 4.47 million hectares of open water bodies (rivers, haors, beels, canals) are home to 250 fish species, including 24 species that breed there. This vast fishery resource is now threatened by climate change. Damage to this resource would severely impact the country’s economy. According to a research report by the international organization Germanwatch, climate change causes Bangladesh an annual loss of $2.189 billion, negatively affecting national growth by 1.81%. The report states that from 1990 to 2009, nearly 20% of the world’s climate-related losses occurred in Bangladesh. Moreover, with decreasing arable land and diminishing fishery and forest resources, Bangladesh’s main revenue sources are at risk. Reduced agriculture-based production will cause the government to lose a substantial portion of its revenue and export income. In such conditions, Bangladesh’s economy will struggle, with expenditure exceeding income. At the national level, Bangladesh faces enormous financial losses due to the need to combat climate change. Implementing the Bay of Bengal Island Plan, a technology- and science-based techno-economic mega-plan, will require about 2.5% of GDP by 2025. To prevent and manage various natural disasters, infrastructural designs must be modified and upgraded. For example, to prevent saline water intrusion, coastal polders need redesigning, repair, and new construction irrigation projects require reform due to changes in river flow and behavior. Moreover, significant budget allocations are required annually to repair or rebuild infrastructure damaged by successive natural disasters. If donor agencies refuse to fund these expenses, the Bangladesh government must cover them from internal revenue, causing fiscal deficits in the domestic market and hindering other vital development projects. According to the IMF, about 80% of least developed countries and 50% of developing countries face extreme climate change risks. Besides Bangladesh, the economies of coastal Cambodia, China, Egypt, Guyana, Suriname, Thailand, and Vietnam will also suffer losses. If temperatures continue to rise, agriculture, forestry, coastal housing, and tourism sectors worldwide will be severely affected. Additionally, nearly half of South Asia’s regions face risks of declining economic growth in the coming decades. Economically, Maldives and Nepal are the most vulnerable, with projected losses of 12.6% and 9.9%, respectively, by century’s end. Bangladesh’s projected loss is 9.4%, close to Nepal’s. What Experts Are Saying in This Situation Dr. A. K. M. Mahmudul Haque, Professor in the Political Science Department at Rajshahi University, states that it is estimated that climate change causes an annual loss of $1.7 trillion. This loss is feared to rise to $3.1 trillion by 2050. These figures are based on research that considers damage to assets, infrastructure, human health, and the agricultural sector. He notes that a study conducted on 163 disasters from 2001 to 2019 attributes the majority of these losses to relatively poor countries. One might then ask: what would have happened if Bangladesh had not suffered from the negative impacts of climate change? Would the country’s economy have shown any positive effects? To answer this, one must understand the nature of climate change in Bangladesh. The area of arable land is also declining at an alarming rate due to climate change. Dr. Haque explains that beyond its direct economic impacts, climate change has many indirect effects. For example, affected populations lose their livelihoods and migrate to large cities, creating overcrowding. It is estimated that by 2050, the number of internal climate migrants in Bangladesh will exceed 20 million. This rapid population growth in cities leads to severe problems such as traffic congestion. Moreover, if these migrants were able to sustain their livelihoods in their own regions, a sustainable flow would be maintained in Bangladesh’s overall GDP. Measuring how much an individual marginal farmer is affected by climate change in Bangladesh is quite difficult. In this situation, relying solely on international donor agencies to resolve the problem is not practical. Instead, strengthening domestic policies—such as developing indigenous technology, expertise, resilience, climate migration management, state initiatives to send and support migrant workers abroad—and ensuring their implementation may be the most effective way forward. Rafid Bin Islam, a young environmental activist and student of the Department of Mass Communication and Journalism at Dhaka University, says the effects of global warming are not only environmental but deeply intertwined with a country’s economy, posing a huge threat to development and prosperity. Labor productivity is declining, while healthcare costs are rising. Other economic sectors are also particularly vulnerable. Climate change plays a direct or indirect role in various issues, including reduced availability of raw materials for industries and shortages of skilled labor. For instance, inland waterway transportation is disrupted during the dry season, which is one of the main modes of transporting goods within the country. This not only poses a major threat to trade activities but also gradually reduces the popularity of waterway communication systems. He also said, the government must take well-regulated measures to reduce the damage caused by climate change. Western countries are already focusing on reducing carbon emissions. The Bangladesh government has expressed its commitment to climate change policies through initiatives like the National Adaptation Program of Action and the Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan. Rafid also said, to tackle this global challenge, the government must prioritize climate change on its agenda. In addition to taking state-level actions, the scope of the United Nations and other organizations must be expanded. By actively addressing climate change, Bangladesh can not only safeguard its increasingly promising economic future but also meet the challenge of protecting the livelihoods of millions of its citizens.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111747,Siblings hacked dead at flat in Tongi,2025-04-18,"Two children have been hacked to death at a flat in Tongi area of Gazipur. Police recovered the bodies of two siblings around 6 pm on Friday (April 18). Parents of the deceased have been taken to the police station for interrogation. Relatives believe that miscreants entered the flat between 4 pm and 5 pm and killed the brother and sister. The deceased are Maliha Akhter (6), daughter of Abdul Baten Mia at Tatuakandi in Bancharampur of Brahmanbaria, and her brother Md. Abdullah (4). According to sources from the locals and relatives of the deceased, Baten Mia used to live with his family in a flat on the third floor of an 8-storey building called Setu Villa in Jamaibazar area of Arichpur in Tongi. The eldest daughter of his three children is at his grandmother's house. Maliha and Abdullah's mother fell asleep after taking headache medicine on Friday afternoon. When she woke up in the afternoon, she saw the bloody bodies of her son and daughter on the floor of the flat. Tongi East Police Station OC Md. Faridul Islam said, “The incident of killing is mysterious. The mother and father of the deceased are giving separate information. Their statements are inconsistent. For this reason, both of them are being interrogated in police custody.”",sibl hack dead flat tongi,two child hack death flat tongi area gazipur polic recov bodi two sibl around 6 prime minist fridai parent deceas take polic station interrog rel believ miscreant enter flat 4 prime minist 5 prime minist kill brother sister deceas maliha akhter daughter abdul baten mia tatuakandi bancharampur brahmanbaria brother md abdullah accord sourc local rel deceas baten mia us live famili flat 3 floor 8storei build call setu villa jamaibazar area arichpur tongi eldest daughter three child grandmoth hous maliha abdullah mother fall asleep take headach medicin fridai afternoon wake afternoon see bloodi bodi son daughter floor flat tongi east polic station oc md faridul islam say incid kill mysteri mother father deceas give separ inform statement inconsist reason interrog polic custodi,two child hack death flat tongi area gazipur polic recov bodi two sibl around 6 prime minist fridai parent deceas take polic station interrog rel believ miscreant enter flat 4 prime minist 5 prime minist kill brother sister deceas maliha akhter daughter abdul baten mia tatuakandi bancharampur brahmanbaria brother md abdullah accord sourc local rel deceas baten mia us live famili flat 3 floor 8storei build call setu villa jamaibazar area arichpur tongi eldest daughter three child grandmoth hous maliha abdullah mother fall asleep take headach medicin fridai afternoon wake afternoon see bloodi bodi son daughter floor flat tongi east polic station oc md faridul islam say incid kill mysteri mother father deceas give separ inform statement inconsist reason interrog polic custodi,2,polic_two_area_confirm,0.045454545454545456,0.4772727272727273,0.03787878787878788,0.05303030303030303,0.06818181818181818,0.06818181818181818,0.06060606060606061,0.08333333333333333,0.045454545454545456,0.06060606060606061
science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111748,There are examples of turning ex-enemies into allies,2025-04-18,"Claiming that the interim government has taken a pro-Bangladesh foreign policy, Chief Adviser's Deputy Press Secretary Abul Kalam Azad Majumder has said there are examples of turning former enemies into allies in the world. “There are many instances of former enemies turning into allies,” he wrote in a post on his verified Facebook account on Friday. Citing examples, he mentioned that France and England fought countless wars for centuries, but joined hands in the Second World War. The US bombed Japan in the same war, but later turned the country into an ally, Azad said. He added: “The other day, we faced a question about whether Bangladesh is shifting its foreign policy to be pro-Pakistan. It did not surprise us at all.” There will always be some people who will rarely believe in Bangladesh’s independent identity, he said. “Our response was obvious. Irrespective of whatever happened in the past with regard to the country’s foreign policy, it will be a pro-Bangladesh policy from now on, driven by our own interest,” the deputy press secretary said. Distancing from one neighbour to keep another happy cannot be the foreign policy of an independent nation, he added. NativeClick Ads He said it took the interim government less than 24 hours to translate its words into action by reminding Amna Baloch, the visiting foreign secretary of Pakistan, the outstanding issues between the two countries, while at the same time agreeing to work together for mutual benefits. One of the emotive issues, of course hindering Bangladesh-Pakistan relations, is Bangladesh’s demand for an apology from Pakistan for the genocide and atrocities committed by its armed forces in 1971, Azad said. He said even many in Pakistan’s civil society, media, and intelligentsia believed that an apology would be an act of goodwill and grace, but the Pakistan’s Foreign Office and military bureaucracy were always opposed to such an idea, and thus a formal apology never came. Bangladesh also pressed for the issue of division of assets, which was a forgotten matter for the past regimes, who preferred disengagement to talks, the deputy press secretary said. According to an estimate, he said, Bangladesh has a claim of at least US$ 4.32 billion as of 1974. The estimate was based on assumptions with respect to internal capital creation, external debt settlement, and retention of external financial assets, he mentioned. He said Bangladesh has an additional claim of about US$ 200 million, which was donated by foreign countries/agencies for the cyclone victims of the then East Pakistan in November 1970. “The money was lying in the office of the State Bank of Pakistan in Dhaka before it was transferred to the Lahore Branch of the State Bank of Pakistan during our war of liberation in 1971,” Azad said. He said the repatriation of stranded Pakistanis was another issue that hindered the relationship between the two countries. In the past, he said, Pakistan only took back around 125,000 of its people, but some 325,000 are housed in 79 camps in 14 districts of Bangladesh. Azad said these are the issues that continued to remain as barriers in order to move towards a healthy and forward-looking bilateral relationship between the two countries. “And the best option to resolve the issues is obviously talks, and this is exactly what the interim government is trying to do”. “It has brought Pakistan to talks after long years and duly raised the issues while at the same time looking to explore trade and commerce potential for mutual benefits,” he wrote in his post. The deputy press secretary reminded that Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus, during his meeting with his counterpart Shehbaz Sharif in Egypt earlier this year, spoke about the need for resolving the outstanding issues, and on Thursday, while holding a meeting with Baloch at the State Guest House Jamuna, he reiterated his call. But, in the same meeting, Prof Yunus insisted on a sound relationship with neighbouring countries, including Pakistan, to tap the huge economic potential of the region, he said. “It is perhaps time for Bangladesh and Pakistan to move on and work together to resolve the past issues for future benefits,” Azad said.",exampl turn exenemi alli,claim interim governmentern take probangladesh foreign

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111751,Govt to increase manpower at Bangladesh missions: Foreign Adviser,2025-04-18,"Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain has said the government is actively working to increase manpower in Bangladesh’s missions abroad, particularly at consulate general offices, to ensure better services for millions of expatriates. The adviser said this while addressing a discussion marking Foreign Service Day-2025 at the Foreign Service Academy in the capital on Friday. “We have initiated efforts to enhance human resources, especially at our consular posts . . . I hope to achieve at least partial success in this endeavor,” he said. Hossain said around 80 percent of the challenges faced by Bangladeshi expatriate workers stem from domestic processes before their migration, while the remaining 20 percent occur in destination countries. “Yet, our missions abroad are left to deal with the entire 100 percent of the problems,” he observed, stressing the importance of addressing root causes at home to ease pressure on foreign missions. Despite limited manpower and logistical constraints, Bangladesh missions are providing services to over 10 million expatriates worldwide, he said. Citing the example of Saudi Arabia, the adviser said nearly 3.2 million Bangladeshis reside in the Kingdom. “How can 50 officials in a mission handle problems of such a vast number?,” he questioned. He urged that initiatives must begin in Dhaka to reduce the systemic difficulties facing migrant workers before they even leave the country. NativeClick Ads Calling for greater empathy among officials, the foreign adviser said, “Expatriates don’t go to missions out of choice. Most arrive in desperation. While a few may behave improperly, the majority come in dire need of support.” He urged officials at missions abroad to serve expatriates with utmost sincerity and dedication, recognising their significant contributions to the nation’s economy. Speaking to reporters after the event, the foreign adviser also addressed the Rohingya repatriation crisis, describing Bangladesh’s current position as a “dilemma.” He identified the Arakan Army, the rebel group who is now controlling most of the area of Myanmar’s Rakhine state, as a major impediment to progress. “The Arakan Army is neither a state actor nor an internationally recognised entity, so formal talks are not possible. Yet, a solution to the crisis is unlikely without engaging them in some form,” he said. Hossain stressed that despite the lack of recognition, the Arakan Army’s presence and influence in Rakhine make their role unavoidable in any comprehensive resolution to the Rohingya crisis. Foreign Secretary Md Jashim Uddin and several former Bangladesh diplomats also spoke at the discussion on different features of the day. Foreign Service Day is observed on April 18 each year, commemorating a pivotal moment during Bangladesh’s Liberation War in 1971 when a group of brave Bengali diplomats serving in the Pakistan Foreign Service first pledged their allegiance to the Provisional Government of Bangladesh. Their bold move marked a significant milestone in the nation's journey toward independence and laid the foundation for an independent foreign policy.

In a statement, the agency warned that “humanitarian aid and supplies have not entered the Gaza Strip since 2 March 2025, when the Israeli Authorities imposed a siege.” “This is already three times longer than the one enforced in October 2023 when the war started,” it added. It noted that there are “at least 20 displacement orders issued by the Israeli military between 18 March and 14 April, in total,” resulting in “about 69% of the Gaza Strip is under active displacement orders, within the ‘no-go’ zone or both.” The agency estimated that “nearly 420,000 people have been displaced yet again since the breakdown of the ceasefire.” It also said that “resumed bombardments and the total restriction on aid are severely hampering humanitarian agencies’ ability to respond to urgent needs—especially food, clean water, sanitation, shelter, and medical supplies.” Israel resumed its attacks in Gaza on March 18, shattering a two-month truce. More than 51,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza in a brutal Israeli onslaught since October 2023, most of them women and children.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111755,"Peace Journalism in Digital Age: HWPL explores ethics, AI, global cooperation",2025-04-19,"The HWPL International Workshop on Peace Journalism Studies, held on April 17, 2025, brought together journalists, scholars, and peace practitioners to explore how peace journalism can help address global challenges such as misinformation and conflict in an era of rapid digital transformation. The event was hosted online by an international peace NGO, Heavenly Culture, World Peace, Restoration of Light (HWPL), with around 200 participants joining from 50 countries. Under the theme of Transforming Conflict through AI and Cultural Understanding, a key focus of the workshop was the growing impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on journalism. Discussions explored how journalists can responsibly integrate new technologies while upholding essential values such as accuracy, fairness, and empathy. The event also featured discussions centered on the recent publication, Peace Journalism Studies (2024). The journal highlights peace journalism’s potential to foster reconciliation and cross-cultural understanding, especially in regions affected by conflict. Case studies demonstrate how constructive reporting can help bridge divides and support long-term peacebuilding. In a congratulatory message, Mr. Berry Lwando, Director General of the Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation, remarked, “In today’s fast-paced media landscape, what we choose to highlight matters. Peace journalism isn’t about ignoring conflict—it’s about framing it in ways that invite dialogue, not division. That’s a responsibility we carry.” Hon. Noel Lipipa, Member of Malawian Parliament for Blantyre City South Constituency, also delivered his congratulatory message. “I’m inspired by the work being done to explore how AI and cultural understanding can help reshape how we tell stories and resolve conflict. The world needs more storytellers committed to peace.” In his article, Director of News, Sports and Current Affairs / ABS TV Radio in Antigua and Barbuda, Mr. Garfield Burford, underscores the importance of evidence-based reporting to counter misinformation. While AI can make journalism more efficient, he cautions that it also raises concerns about accuracy and trust. He emphasizes that ethical judgment and human empathy remain essential to the work of a journalist. Mr. Sijam Sinjali, CEO of Agleshwori Hills Development Trust in Nepal, discusses the role of peace journalism in encouraging non-violent conflict resolution. His essay explores the challenges and ethical responsibilities peace journalists face, and how technology may help support more informed, solution-oriented reporting. NativeClick Ads From the Philippines, Dr. Musa Damao, Executive Director of Bangsamoro Dialogue for Peace and Justice, Inc., highlights how peace journalism supports the Bangsamoro peace process. He advocates for integrating peace education into school curricula and highlights how morally grounded journalism can contribute to lasting peace and development. CEO of Varna Institute for Peace Research in Austria, Mr. Josef Mühlbauer, explores how open dialogue and debate can help challenge harmful narratives. He references the “Varna Peace Institute” podcast as a platform where open discussions help uncover root causes of conflict and promote understanding. In her contribution, Ms. Tuty Purwaningsih, Director of Media Desa in Indonesia, looks at how families and communities teach values like tolerance and empathy, and how the media can amplify these efforts by focusing on constructive stories. The workshop also aligned with HWPL’s broader peace initiatives, particularly the Declaration of Peace and Cessation of War (DPCW). Article 10 of the DPCW, “Spreading a Culture of Peace,” emphasizes the role of media in promoting harmony through responsible communication. HWPL continues to advocate for journalism that contributes to a more peaceful and inclusive society. The event concluded with a call for stronger collaboration among journalists, academics, and peacebuilders, reaffirming a shared commitment to ethical and thoughtful journalism in a rapidly evolving

The incident took place around 3 am, following which rescue operations involving teams from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), Delhi Fire Services and Delhi Police were launched, senior police officer Sandeep Lamba said. “14 people have been rescued, and four have died. About 8-10 people are still feared trapped,” Mr Lamba said. Asked about the reason behind the collapse, Mr Lamba said they will investigate it. The injured have been taken to the GTB hospital. An official described it as a “pancake collapse”, in which, he said, the chances of survival are “minimal”. “Still, we hope there are lives that can be saved and are actively searching. Debris is being cleared slowly and thoroughly checked,” according to NDRF’s Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Mohsen Shahidi. He also said that working in such congested areas is “extremely challenging”. NativeClick Ads “The use of heavy machinery to clear debris is limited due to space constraints,” Mr Shahidi said. Rajendra Atwal, the Divisional Fire Officer, said they received a call about the incident at around 2:50 am. “We reached the spot and found out that the entire building had collapsed, and people were trapped under the debris. The NDRF and the Delhi Fire Services are working to rescue the people,” he said. The house collapse incident was reported hours after parts of Delhi witnessed heavy rain, accompanied by gusty winds and thunderstorms.

The team have secured their spot by the slimmest of margins. Pakistan have secured the World Cup with the highest 10 points. Bangladesh’s run rate was 0.639 with 6 points in five matches. Despite scoring a record 168 runs in 10.5 overs against Thailand, the Windies could not make it to the World Cup. Even though they had equal points after five matches, the Windies' run rate was 0.626. As a result, their name was dropped from the World Cup team. The Caribbean side, needing to chase down 167 in just 10.3 overs to surpass Bangladesh’s NRR, launched a ferocious counter-attack.

In a social media post on Saturday, External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said the ‘brutal killing’of Bhabesh Chandra Roy follows a ‘pattern of systematic persecution’ of Hindu minorities in Bangladesh. “We have noted with distress the abduction and brutal killing of Shri Bhabesh Chandra Roy, a Hindu minority leader in Bangladesh,” he said. “This killing follows a pattern of systematic persecution of Hindu minorities under the interim government even as the perpetrators of previous such events roam with impunity,” Jaiswal said. “We condemn this incident and once again remind the interim government to live up to its responsibility of protecting all minorities, including Hindus, without inventing excuses or making distinctions,” he added. There has been a sharp downturn in India-Bangladesh relations after deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina fled Dhaka in August last year in the face of a massive anti-government protest.

Members of the Women's Affairs Reform Commission, led by its chief Shireen Parveen Haque, handed over the report to the Chief Adviser at the State Guest House Jamuna on Saturday (April 19). “We proposed establishing an independent permanent women affairs commission, which will observe and monitor the violation of women’s rights and ensure their protection,” Commission Chief Shireen Parveen Haque told a press briefing. The briefing was arranged at the Foreign Service Academy to inform media of the findings of the report prepared by the commission. Citing the proposals of the Commission, Shireen said recommendations have been divided into three parts, saying that they proposed some recommendations, which can be implemented during the interim government and some recommendations have been made for the next elected government. She said the commission proposed removing all forms of discriminations from the family law and other laws, and acknowledging food, cloth, accommodation, education, health and works in the constitution as the fundamental rights.

Shafiqul Alam said: “We reject this baseless claim.” He mentioned that Bangladesh is not a country where one will find government-sponsored systematic discrimination against minorities. The press secretary reiterated that the Bangladesh government protects the rights of all of its citizens irrespective of religious denominations. “In this particular case, we have ascertained that the victim went out with some individuals previously known to him. Nobody from the victim’s family reported his going out with them as suspicious,” he said. Alam said the autopsy report did not detect any prima facie sign of bodily injury. However, the authorities have ordered viscera analysis to conclusively determine the cause of death, he said, adding that appropriate actions would be taken once the viscera report is available.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111775,Thousands join anti-Trump protests across US,2025-04-20,"Thousands took to the streets across the US on Saturday to protest over recent actions by President Donald Trump, the BBC reported. Known as ""50501"", for ""50 protests, 50 states, 1 movement"", the demonstrations were intended to coincide with the 250th anniversary of the start of the American Revolutionary War. From outside the White House and Tesla dealerships and at the centres of many cities, protesters expressed a variety of grievances. Many called for the return of Kilmar Ábrego García, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Political protests are becoming more common in the US - the ""Hands Off"" demonstrations in early April drew tens of thousands in cities across the country. The most recent polling from Gallup suggests 45% of voters approve of Trump's performance in the first quarter of his term, which is more than the 41% who approved during the same period in his first administration. Still, it is lower than the average first-quarter rating of 60% for all presidents elected between 1952 and 2020. Saturday's protests addressed a number of Trump actions, including those by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) - Trump's initiative to cut US government jobs and other spending - and the administration's unwillingness to bring about the return of Ábrego García, a citizen of El Salvador. Gihad Elgendy told CNN he joined the protest at the White House to criticise the deportation of Ábrego García. He believes Trump ""could easily pressure El Salvador to bring him back"". NativeClick Ads The protests were generally reported as peaceful, although Representative Suhas Subramanyam, a Democrat, posted a video on X of a man holding a Trump sign and pushing through a crowd to angrily confront him. Many demonstrators carried signs reading ""No Kings,"" a nod to the anniversary of the start of the country's revolution against English rule. During celebrations of the anniversary in Massachusetts that commemorated the battles of Lexington and Concord and the famous horse ride of Paul Revere, people held similar signs. There was also a 50501 demonstration in Boston on Saturday. ""This is a very perilous time in America for liberty,"" Thomas Bassford, told the Associated Press, while in Boston with his partner, daughter and two grandsons. ""I wanted the boys to learn about the origins of this country and that sometimes we have to fight for freedom."" Trump's popularity appears to be edging down, especially when it comes to the economy. When he took office in January, his approval rating was 47%, according to Gallup. His approval rating in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll similarly dipped to 43% from 47% on Inauguration Day.

The Chief Adviser made the request when UN Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix met him at the State Guest House Jamuna on Sunday (April 20). ""One thing that I encourage is the participation of more Bangladeshi women in peacekeeping missions,"" said the Chief Adviser during the meeting when issues with regard to UN peacekeeping were discussed elaborately. Bangladesh consistently ranks among the top three troop/police-contributing countries (TPCCs), with 5,677 peacekeepers across 10 of the 11 active missions. The UN Under-Secretary-General highlighted the UN policy of engaging more women in peacekeeping. ""We don't want to confine women to specific roles,"" he said, adding the UN would support recruiting women in all aspects of peacekeeping. Prof Yunus expressed Bangladesh's readiness to deploy additional troops and police when required, underscoring Bangladesh's pledge of five units at the Rapid Deployment Level in the Peacekeeping Capability Readiness System (PCRS). He also advocated for increased Bangladeshi representation in UN peacekeeping leadership at both headquarters and field levels.

During the meeting, they reviewed the outcomes of the Chief Adviser’s recent visit to China and outlined next steps for accelerating Bangladesh-China cooperation. Both sides expressed a shared commitment to transforming discussions into actionable projects across a range of sectors- including infrastructure, trade, healthcare, education, and culture. “Our top priority now is to move forward with the plans we discussed during the China visit,” said the Chief Adviser. “We want to make sure momentum is not lost.” The Chinese Ambassador echoed the Chief Adviser’s sentiment, saying, “This is also our top priority. We had one of the highest-level agenda meetings in China, and we do not want to wait another two to three years just to sign agreements- we want to implement them quickly.” One of the topics discussed was the development of the Mongla and Anowara economic zones. BIDA Executive Chairman Chowdhury Ashik Mahmud Bin Harun informed that preparations are underway and, once completed, the zones will be handed over to developers to begin implementation. NativeClick Ads The two sides also discussed a plan to procure four new vessels from China, with the Chinese side assuring that the process would be completed by June this year, said sources at the Chief Adviser’s Office. The Chinese envoy also confirmed that China’s Commerce Minister will visit Bangladesh soon, accompanied by a 100-member delegation of investors aiming to explore new investment opportunities. “We will organise a mini-investment summit focused on Chinese investors to strengthen sector-specific collaboration,” said BIDA Chairman Ashik. Healthcare cooperation featured prominently in the discussion. The Chinese side reaffirmed their commitment to building a 1,000-bed hospital in Bangladesh, as initially proposed during the China visit. They also highlighted ongoing support in establishing a specialised burn unit in Chattogram. The Chinese Ambassador informed that progress is being made to launch a direct Kunming–Chittagong flight, and efforts are underway to expedite medical visas for Bangladeshi patients. Prof Yunus stressed the importance of cultural exchange, proposing the establishment of a Chinese Cultural Centre and Language Institute to allow young Bangladeshis to engage more closely with Chinese language and culture. Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to launching a long-term, 50-year master plan on water management, including work on the Teesta River system. The Chief Adviser also raised the possibility of expanding jute exports to China and urged greater Chinese investment in the locomotive sector. He proposed setting up locomotive manufacturing and maintenance hubs in both Chattogram and Syedpur, alongside capacity-building workshops and training programmes. Agricultural trade was another area of progress.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111793,"US airstrikes kill 12, injure 30 in Yemen",2025-04-21,"The death toll from fresh U.S. airstrikes on a crowded market in Yemen’s capital Sanaa on Sunday evening has risen to 12, with at least 30 others wounded, Houthi-controlled health authorities said in a statement. According to Houthi-run al-Masirah TV, the airstrikes targeted the Farwah market in the Shu’ub neighborhood, one of the busiest markets in Sanaa. Rescue operations are ongoing, with teams searching for survivors and victims beneath the rubble. The strikes were part of a broader wave of U.S. airstrikes that hit multiple locations in and around Sanaa on Sunday, the Houthi media outlet added. The incident came days after the deadly U.S. airstrikes on the Ras Isa fuel port in western Yemen late Thursday night that killed 80 people, wounded 170 others, and caused widespread damage to fuel storage infrastructure, leading to fuel spills into the Red Sea, according to local Houthi health officials. Tensions between the Houthi group and the U.S. military have escalated since Washington resumed airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen on March 15 to deter the group from attacking Israel and U.S. warships in the Red Sea. The Houthis, which control much of northern Yemen, said their attacks aim to press U.S.-backed Israel to stop the offensive against the Gaza Strip and allow the entry of humanitarian aid into the Palestinian enclave.

Parvez, 24, was a student of the 223rd batch of the university’s Textile Engineering Department. The victim’s brother, Humayun Kabir, lodged the case at Banani Police Station in the early hours of Sunday (April 20). Eight students of the university have been named as primary accused. Additionally, 20 to 30 unnamed individuals were also accused in the case. According to campus sources, the dispute began around 4 PM on Saturday when Parvez went to a nearby alley for snacks. There, three female students reportedly accused him of eve-teasing. The university administration attempted to mediate the matter and ease tensions. However, coming out of the proctor’s office, a group of outsiders attacked Parvez. He sustained critical injuries after being stabbed in the chest. His friends rushed him to Kurmitola General Hospital, where doctors declared him dead upon arrival.

He was 88 years old, Al Jazeera reports. Born in Argentina, he was the first Latin American pope as well as the first non-European to serve for more than 1,000 years. He was known for his simple words and humble manner that immediately won over the crowds. After he assumed the papacy in 2013, Francis aimed to make the church more inclusive, opening up key roles to women and trying to address the issue of child sex abuse by Catholic clerics. Analysts, however, remain divided about the success of his efforts. The 88-year-old pontiff was recovering from double pneumonia and was under doctors’ orders to observe two months of convalescence since he left Rome’s Gemelli Hospital on March 23. Francis suffered from a number of health issues throughout his life, including having part of one of his lungs removed at the age of 21. He became increasingly fragile in recent years. World leaders are paying tribute, with French President Emmanuel Macron calling him a “man of humility” and the Dutch PM describing him as a “role model for Catholics and non-Catholics alike”. NativeClick Ads The Pope’s death comes fewer than 24 hours after he made an appearance at the Vatican’s St Peter’s Square for Easter Sunday. He came out in a wheelchair and waved from the balcony of St Peter’s Basilica to cheering crowds and said: “Dear brothers and sisters, happy Easter.” His traditional Easter address and blessing was read by an aide while he sat, watching. Following the blessing, he was driven around the square.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111807,Bangladesh Investment Summit-2025 to help woo FDI,2025-04-21,"The Bangladesh Investment Summit-2025, organized by the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) recently, primarily gives a positive branding about Bangladesh as an investment destination to entrepreneurs and investors in overseas countries. Nuria Lopez, Chairperson of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in Bangladesh (EuroCham), said this. EuroCham officially launched on 3 December 2024 at the Hotel Radisson in Dhaka is a business initiative that is actively supported by the European Union Delegation and the EU Member States in Bangladesh. The Chamber will serve as a centre of excellence, promoting business relations between European investors and their counterparts in the country. Nuria Lopez, a Spanish citizen and Managing Director of Zalo Knitting Ltd, a leading entrepreneur in the export-oriented readymade garment industry, has been living in Bangladesh since the early 90s. The presentation of the Bangladesh Investment Summit-2025 is different this year compared to the summits held in the previous years, said Nuria Lopez. However, law and order situation, transparent bureaucracy, timely execution of orders at the grassroots levels, uninterrupted power generation, continuation of investment policy and repatriation of profits are also to be ensured, said Nuria Lopez. BIDA Executive Chairman Chowdhury Ashik Mahmud Bin Harun presented the business and investment potential of Bangladesh. NativeClick Ads Chowdhury Ashik Mahmud is working to turn the BIDA into energetic and robust organization with a vision to woo foreign direct investment (FDI), said Nuria Lopez. The Spanish entrepreneur also said that Pran-RFL Group, in collaboration with H&M Group and International Finance Corporation (IFC), has announced plans to generate solar power, to be used in the apparel sector, marking a significant step towards promoting sustainability within the country's vital RMG industry. The clean electricity will be purchased by Bangladeshi garment suppliers serving the globally renowned Swedish brand Hennes & Mauritz AB (H&M), The MoU sets the stage for piloting Bangladesh's first Corporate Power Purchase Agreement (CPPA). Supported by the IFC and led by Pran-RFL Group, this project will link several of H&M's selected suppliers to a newly-developed solar park. Oscar Garca Maceiras, CEO of Inditex, had signed a deal with Pran Group to set up a power plant that will help ease power crisis in the country. Bangladesh’s economy will be in deep crisis unless a congenial environment and uninterrupted production are ensured in the export–oriented garment industry, the largest earner of export earnings of the country, said Nuria Lopez, also former president of Spain Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Corruption, nepotism, mismanagement and plundering of the state wealth plagued the economy of Bangladesh during the last several years that will stage back under the prudent leadership of Bangladesh's interim government Nobel Peace Laureate Professor Dr. Muhammad Yunus, said Nuria Lopez. Nuria Lopez, a Spanish national who came to Bangladesh in the early 90s and set up the export –oriented garment industry in Gazipur, said the readymade garment industry (RMG) is the backbone of the economy generating some 4.00 million jobs directly and indirectly some 15 million jobs in the country. Bangladesh received its lowest net foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow in the past five years in 2024, as the country experienced political turmoil and economic instability. A sluggish inflow in the first half of the year, compounded by mass uprising, the subsequent departure of the Awami League government in August, and a volatile forex situation throughout the year, contributed by experts to a 13.25% year-on-year decrease in net FDI in 2024. According to central bank data, net FDI inflow amounted to $1.27 billion in 2024, significantly down from $1.46 billion a year ago. When asked why FDI declined in 2024, Mohammad Ali, managing director and chief executive officer of Pubali Bank, said that foreign investors lacked confidence in the year against the backdrop of sliding in the law and order situation of the country after the political changeover. He said, “We did not receive much foreign investment during the first six months of 2024. Then in July, following student-led mass protests, the government was overthrown in August and a new interim government took office”. “During that period, the country's law and order situation deteriorated, although conditions began to improve after December. Foreign investors generally lack confidence in such situations, which is the main reason why FDI in 2024 was lower compared to previous years.” Meanwhile, the interim government has a major task to ensure sound law and order situation as the past Awami League government transformed the country’s law enforcement agencies into ‘monsters’ over the last 15 years. The Bangladesh economy will suffer heavily provided the export-oriented garment industry, the largest earner of export earnings of the country, are being targeted by miscreants, said Nuria Lopez. Meanwhile, the Spanish entrepreneur has expressed his support to Bangladesh's interim government led by Nobel Peace Laureate Professor Dr. Muhammad Yunus. The interim government should ensure sound law and order situation and protect business establishments and businessmen to revive the economy, said leaders of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (JBCCI), International Chamber of Commerce, Bangladesh (ICCB), Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI) while talking to this correspondent. However, as the country is going through a transition period, smooth engagement and participation of the existing import and export houses in the country is also important to retain the economy on the right track. The economy of Bangladesh has suffered a massive blow during the student movement on quota system in the government job during the period of July, 2024. Managing Director of Zalo Knitting Ltd, Nuria Lopez said that the employment generation in the economy is important as some 20 lakh youths are entering the job market every year. The RMG is the labour intensive industry and the highly densely populated country like Bangladesh can’t sustain generating thousands of jobs. Urging the stakeholders concerned to extend cooperation to the Nobel laureate to carry out necessary reforms, the economy will require several years to overcome the loss centering movement and violence and laid emphasis on normalcy to run business. High economic disparity, corruption, nepotism, slow employment creation, Russia-Ukraine war, siphoning off state wealth out of the country by some corrupt persons have created a crisis in the economy, she said. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has praised Bangladesh's measures, taken by the interim government, to overcome economic challenges due to the recent turbulence and major floods. “In response to the challenging circumstances, the authorities' efforts to initiate adjustments, including continued monetary tightening and rationalizing non-priority capital spending are commendable,"" IMF Mission Chief for Bangladesh Chris Papageorgiou said. BIDA Executive Chairman Chowdhury Ashik Mahmud Bin Harun presented the business and investment potential of Bangladesh. Meanwhile, Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus recently urged the global investors to come up with their business in Bangladesh to change the world saying Bangladesh is the best place for investment. “Bangladesh is a country with crazy ideas to change the world...so we invite you to join that craft not only to change Bangladesh by your business but to change the world,” he said while addressing the inaugural session of Bangladesh Investment Summit-2025 at Hotel Intercontinental here. Prof Yunus said: “If you want to make a business with a purpose, along with the business we do, Bangladesh is the place."" Meanwhile, the recently concluded Bangladesh Investment Summit 2025 has yielded investment declaration worth Tk 3,100 crore, says Chowdhury Ashik Mahmud Bin Harun, executive chairman of the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA). He shared the information at a press conference at the Foreign Service Academy in the capital. The European Union Chamber of Commerce in Bangladesh (EuroCham) has laid emphasis on a collaborative and transparent approach to energy pricing reforms, voicing concerns over the recently proposed gas tariff structure by the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC). In a statement, EuroCham acknowledged the government's strides toward a sustainable energy future but warned that the differential tariff mechanism — based on industrial consumers' contractual timelines and gas connection status — could inadvertently hurt investor sentiment and industrial growth. According to the chamber, the newly-proposed model risks placing an unfair burden on new and expanding industries, which would face significantly higher gas tariffs than their long-established counterparts — despite operating within the same sector. “Fragmented energy costs across similar operations may erode Bangladesh's competitive edge and discourage both foreign and domestic investment,” said EuroCham, pointing out that the proposed structure comes at a time when Bangladesh is actively courting global investors. EuroCham echoed the concerns voiced by industry stakeholders during BERC's public hearing in February and backed calls for a more inclusive, consultative reform process. The chamber encouraged BERC to engage more deeply with both foreign and domestic stakeholders when crafting energy policies that impact long-term business planning. “Energy pricing must align with Bangladesh's broader goals of industrial resilience, energy security, and sustainable development,"" the chamber noted. Reaffirming its commitment to Bangladesh's development journey, EuroCham pledged to work closely with the government to shape policies that foster inclusive growth and a globally competitive investment climate. With energy reforms at a critical juncture, the chamber's message underscores the need for policy alignment that not only addresses sustainability but also nurtures the confidence of investors driving the country's industrial future. The cost of doing business is high that sometimes erode the competiveness of the local industries, said business leaders in Bangladesh demanding an improvement in ease of doing business to establish a conducive trade and investment ecosystem. The major challenges for the national budget for the fiscal year 2024-25 will be controlling inflation, increasing the foreign exchange reserves, exports, and the tax-GDP ratio, and bringing reforms in the banking sector. Global FDI amounted to $1.3 trillion in 2022, with nearly half being made in Asia. South Asia saw an overall 7 percent increase, but Bangladesh witnessed a decline. ""Additionally, the customs, tax and VAT systems have to be automated and if the National Logistics Development Policy is implemented, it will help cut the cost of doing business,"" said Mahbubul Alam, president of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Emphasis should also be placed so that the interest rate of bank loans does not go up. This is because if the interest rate climbs, industrialisation and investment in the country will be hampered. According to the latest United Nations Trade and Development report, global FDI amounted to $1.3 trillion in 2022, with nearly half being made in Asia. South Asia saw an overall 7 percent increase, but Bangladesh saw a decline. FDI in Bangladesh amounted to just 0.4 percent of the country's GDP in 2022 while the ratio was 1.5 percent in India and 4.4 percent in Vietnam. In 2023, FDI to Bangladesh snapped its rising trend. Central bank data showed last week that the country received $3 billion in FDI last year, a decrease of 14 percent from $3.5 billion in 2022. An analysis of the central bank data shows that Bangladesh received $1.57 billion in net FDI in 2021. Since then, net FDI has declined each year compared to the previous one. Overall, based on revised data following the BPM6 manual, the net FDI received in 2024 is the lowest since 2020. Data prior to 2000 was recorded according to the BPM5 manual, and therefore cannot be compared with the more recent figures. The central bank data analysis shows that of the net FDI received in 2024, $622 million came from reinvested earnings. In other words, 49% of the total net FDI for the year was reinvested earnings. In addition, $545 million entered the country as equity capital. Furthermore, $104 million came as intra-company loans. When asked why reinvested earnings make up a major portion of FDI, a senior official of the central bank explained, “The return on investment in our country is quite good. As a result, many investors choose to reinvest the income they earn from their existing investments. However, in many cases, investors face various obstacles, including a shortage of US dollars, when trying to repatriate their earnings. Consequently, they are often compelled to reinvest their earnings.” According to the central bank data, in 2024, the highest investment — $416 million — was made in the banking sector. Additionally, the textile and wearing sector received $407 million in investment. Sectors such as pharmaceuticals and chemicals, power, gas and petroleum, and food also attracted significant investment. Echoing Mohammad Ali, a deputy managing director of a private bank said, “When a new government comes to power, there is often a possibility of changes in various policies, including tax rates. The current government is a short-term one, so investors are waiting to see what kind of policy changes might occur once a more stable government is in place. This is one of the key reasons behind the decline in foreign investment.” In the second week of April, the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (Bida) and the Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (Beza) jointly organised the Bangladesh Investment Summit 2025. Chowdhury Ashik Mahmud Bin Harunsaid that the investment summit successfully created immense potential for attracting both foreign and local direct investment. He pointed out that the summit drew 415 foreign delegates from 50 countries.

In a condolence message on Monday, he said: “On behalf of the government and the people of Bangladesh, we, with a heavy heart, express our deepest condolences at the sad demise of His Holiness Pope Francis, a beacon of peace, humanity and unity.” With his passing away, the Chief Adviser said, they have seen the end of an epoch of dignified papacy, honed by suave leadership qualities, carried out for uplifting human dignity, interfaith harmony, and justice for the marginalised. The leadership of Pope Francis transcended religious boundaries and inspired millions to step up efforts to build a more inclusive, tolerant and compassionate world, he said. Prof Yunus said he has been honoured to meet many times with Pope Francis and to work closely with him to foster peace, human dignity and environmental stewardship. The people of Bangladesh, who were deeply honoured by His Holiness' historic visit to Bangladesh in 2017, join the global community in mourning this great loss, he continued. The Chief Adviser said: “During this time of sorrow, we stand in solidarity with the Catholic Church and people of faith around the globe, remembering the profound impact of his teachings and the kindness he extended to all.” “May the departed soul rest in eternal peace. May we continue to honour his vision of a world united in compassion and understanding,” he added.

The Trump administration has started talks with trading partners over tariffs, with a Japanese delegation visiting Washington last week and South Korea is set to start negotiations this week.

""China firmly opposes any party reaching a deal at the expense of China's interests. If this happens, China will never accept it and will resolutely take countermeasures"".

The decision came on Monday after the government assured the farmers of taking steps to regulate markets and meet their demands. BPA President Sumon Hawlader said the government efforts have assured marginal farmers that they can sustain their production activities. They have, however, threatened to re-announce the movement, if the government promises remain unmet. Earlier on April 17, BPA announced to close egg and chicken farms across the country from May 1. The association announced this through a statement sent to media houses. In the statement, BPA President Md. Sumon Howlader alleged that the poultry industry has suffered huge losses during the Eid season due to the control of syndicates. The losses in the egg and chicken sector in two months reached Tk 1,260 crore. During the Ramadan and Eid, marginal farmers produced two lakh kgs of chicken every day. The farmers lost Tk 30 per kg and about 900 crore taka in a month, he said. NativeClick Ads On the other hand, this season, marginal farmers produced 3 crore eggs. At a loss of 2 taka per egg, they lost 360 crore taka in two months.

Dhaka Metropolitan Senior Special Judge Md Zakir Hossain Galib passed the order on Monday, allowing a plea of the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC). Confirming the matter to newsmen, ACC Deputy Director (public relations) Aktarul Islam said the accounts have Taka 26.05 lakh in them. The ACC in its plea said it is probing allegations against Jobaer of taking money from different people, promising them of giving government jobs, amassing huge illegal wealth by misusing his power, laundering money and buying house in London through the ill-gotten money. A Dhaka court has also ordered to attach 100 acres of land in sector 19 of Purbachal New City Project which had been allocated for the construction of a 100 to 142- storey Icon Tower. The land was temporarily allotted to Power Pace Holding Limited, a company, owned by Ron Haque Sikder, Managing Director of the Sikder Group. Dhaka Metropolitan Senior Special Judge Md. Zakir Hossain Ghalib issued the order in response to a petition on Monday, filed by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), said Akhtarul Islam, ACC Deputy Director. According to the petition, a seven-member investigation team has been formed to probe allegations against Zainul Haque Sikder, Chairman of the Board of Directors of National Bank Limited, and his associates. NativeClick Ads The allegations include corruption, misuse of power, embezzlement of public funds under false pretences, illegal loans in exchange of bribes and money laundering, which are linked to Sikder Group. During the investigation, it was unearthed that RAJUK’s Central Business District (CBD) temporarily allotted the land to Power Pace Holding Limited, owned by Ron Haque Sikder for constructing an Iconic Tower in the Purbachal New City Project. The plot was allotted through a manipulated auction at a fixed rate of TK 30.25 crore per acre. Upon document review and site inspection, it was found that the Sikder Group’s private security force had taken control of the land by paying an instalment of TK 270.50 crore. A three-story building was also being constructed on the site without RAJUK’s approval. Power was supplied by self-constructed power houses. Besides, in the disguise of development work, a fabricated record was created through Fast Security Islami Bank PLC, Kawran Bazar branch. Based on this, a loan of TK 110.27 crore was approved, disbursed, and then misused through illicit transfer and conversion.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111818,Trump sued over Harvard funding freeze,2025-04-22,"Harvard University filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration to stop billions of dollars in proposed cuts, the BBC reported. The suit filed Monday is part of a feud that escalated last week when the elite institution rejected a list of demands that the Trump administration said was designed to curb diversity initiatives and fight anti-semitism at the school. President Donald Trump froze $2.2bn (£1.7bn) of federal funding and also threatened the university’s tax-exempt status. “The consequences of the government’s overreach will be severe and long-lasting,” Harvard’s president Alan M. Garber said in a letter to the university on Monday. The White House responded later Monday night in a statement. “The gravy train of federal assistance to institutions like Harvard, which enrich their grossly overpaid bureaucrats with tax dollars from struggling American families is coming to an end. Taxpayer funds are a privilege, and Harvard fails to meet the basic conditions required to access that privilege”, said White House spokesman Harrison Fields. Mr Garber said the funding freeze affected critical research including studies on pediatric cancer, Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. “In recent weeks, the federal Government has launched a broad attack on the critical funding partnerships that make this invaluable research possible,” the school’s lawsuit said. NativeClick Ads “This case involves the Government’s efforts to use the withholding of federal funding as leverage to gain control of academic decisionmaking at Harvard.” Aside from funding, the Trump administration days ago also threatened Harvard's ability to enroll international students. Mr Garber, who is Jewish, acknowledged Harvard's campus has had issues with anti-semitism but said he had established task forces to work with the problem. He said the university would release the report of two task forces that looked into anti-semitism and anti-Muslim bias. The prominent US university, located in Massachusetts, is not the only institution faced with withholding of federal dollars, which play an outsized role in funding new scientific breakthroughs. The administration has targeted other private Ivy League institutions including suspending $1bn at Cornell University and $510 million at Brown University. Others such as Columbia University, the epicentre of pro-Palestinian campus protests last year, have agreed to some demands after $400 million of federal funds was threatened. The demands to Harvard included agreeing to government-approved external audits of the university's curriculum as well as hiring and admission data. In response, Harvard released a blistering letter rejecting them. ""The university will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,"" Harvard's lawyers told the administration on April 14. ""Neither Harvard nor any other private university can allow itself to be taken over by the federal government. Accordingly, Harvard will not accept the government's terms as an agreement in principle.""

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111819,Trump issues ‘non-tariff cheating’ warning,2025-04-22,"US President Donald Trump on Sunday issued an eight-point ‘non-tariff cheating’ list, warning countries of non-tariff-related offences that could spoil relations with the US. The warning came days after Trump announced a 90-day pause on his sweeping tariffs on all countries, barring China. In the eight-point list, Trump mentioned currency manipulation - an accusation he has made previously on some countries for deliberately devaluing their currencies to make their exports more competitive while making US products costlier abroad. Another warning is about Value-Added Taxes (VATs) that are applied to imports but refunded on exports in many nations. The Republican leader also warned countries of dumping below cost, export and other government subsidies, protective agricultural standards, counterfeiting, piracy, and IP theft, and transshipping to evade tariffs. He also warned of protective technical standards, citing Japan’s ‘bowling ball test’ - a claim Trump made first in 2018. According to Trump, Japan uses a so-called “bowling ball test” to cheat US auto companies out of selling cars to Japanese consumers. “They take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and drop it on the hood of the car. If the hood dents, the car doesn’t qualify. It’s horrible,” he had said. On April 9, Trump announced a 90-day pause on his sweeping tariffs on all countries, barring China - a move that had seemed nearly impossible. According to Trump, who had introduced the slew of tariffs to address the alleged trade imbalance with the US, over 75 countries had negotiated and not retaliated against him - which led to the pause. During the 90 days, a significantly reduced reciprocal tariff of just 10 per cent would be in effect, he said. A growing alarm inside the Treasury Department over the developments in the bond market was reportedly the only factor that made Trump hit a pause on his reciprocal tariff regime._NDTV NativeClick Ads",trump issu nontariff cheat warn,unit state presid donald trump sundai issu eightpoint nontariff cheat list warn countri nontariffrel offenc spoil relat unit state warn come dai trump announc 90dai paus sweep tariff countri bar china eightpoint list trump mention currenc manipul accus make previous countri deliber devalu currenc make export competit make unit state product costly abroad anoth warn valuead tax appli import refund export mani nation republican leader also warn countri dump cost export governmentern subsidi protect agricultur standard counterfeit piraci ip theft transship evad tariff also warn protect technic standard cite japan bowl ball test claim trump make first 2018 accord trump japan us socal bowl ball test cheat unit state auto compani sell car japanes consum take bowl ball 20 foot air drop hood car hood dent car qualifi horribl say april 9 trump announc 90dai paus sweep tariff countri bar china move seem nearli imposs accord trump introduc slay tariff address alleg trade imbal unit state 75 countri negoti retali lead paus 90 dai significantli reduc reciproc tariff just 10 per cent effect say grow alarm insid treasuri depart develop bond market reportedli factor make trump hit paus reciproc tariff regimendtv nativeclick ad,unit state presid donald trump sundai issu eightpoint nontariff cheat list warn countri nontariffrel offenc spoil relat unit state warn come dai trump announc 90dai paus sweep tariff countri bar china eightpoint list trump mention currenc manipul accus make previous countri deliber devalu currenc make export competit make unit state product costly abroad anoth warn valuead tax appli import refund export mani nation republican leader also warn countri dump cost export governmentern subsidi protect agricultur standard counterfeit piraci ip theft transship evad tariff also warn protect technic standard cite japan bowl ball test claim trump make first 2018 accord trump japan us socal bowl ball test cheat unit state auto compani sell car japanes consum take bowl ball 20 foot air drop hood car hood dent car qualifi horribl say april 9 trump announc 90dai paus sweep tariff countri bar china move seem nearli imposs accord trump introduc slay tariff address alleg trade imbal unit state 75 countri negoti retali lead paus 90 dai significantli reduc reciproc tariff just 10 per cent effect say grow alarm insid treasuri depart develop bond market reportedli factor make trump hit paus reciproc tariff regimendtv nativeclick ad,1,state_unit_say_trump,0.4782608695652174,0.02717391304347826,0.11413043478260869,0.059782608695652176,0.05434782608695652,0.043478260869565216,0.06521739130434782,0.03260869565217391,0.04891304347826087,0.07608695652173914
science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111820,Vatican reveals reason behind Pope’s death,2025-04-22,"Pope Francis, the first Latin American leader of the Roman Catholic Church, died of a cerebral stroke and irreversible heart failure, Vatican doctor Andrea Arcangeli says in a death certificate. The certificate released on Monday for the 88-year-old pontiff said the pope had fallen into a coma before his death on Monday morning. Francis died of “cerebral stroke, coma, irreversible cardiocirculatory collapse”, the death certificate said. It added that the first Latin American pontiff in the history of the Roman Catholic Church died at 7:35am (05:35 GMT) in his apartment at the Santa Marta residence in the Vatican. Just a day earlier, the pontiff made what would be his final major appearance as he greeted thousands of Easter worshippers from an open-top popemobile in St Peter’s Square and delivered a blessing through an aide. Francis had suffered various ailments during his 12-year papacy with life-threatening complications in recent weeks during a bout of double pneumonia, for which he spent 38 days at Rome’s Gemelli University Hospital in February and March. The death certificate added that Francis also suffered from arterial hypertension, multiple bronchiectasis and type 2 diabetes, ailments that had not been previously disclosed. The Vatican also released Francis’s spiritual testament – a written statement of faith – in which he said he wished to be buried in Rome’s Basilica of St Mary Major and not at St Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican, unlike many of his predecessors. Francis’s death marks the beginning of nine days of mourning called the Novendiale. NativeClick Ads His body will be dressed in papal vestments and placed in St Peter’s Basilica for public viewing before his burial. Daily prayer services and Requiem Masses will be held in Catholic churches worldwide and at St Peter’s Basilica during this time. The Vatican also enters a transitional period called the sede vacante or interregnum, during which power is handed over to the College of Cardinals, but no major decisions will be made until the papacy is filled.

Putin told Russian state TV on Monday that he had a “positive attitude towards any peace initiatives” and that he hoped Kyiv would “feel the same way”. Moscow and Kyiv have held no bilateral talks since the immediate aftermath of Russia’s February 2022 invasion. However, the United States has been raising the pressure on them to agree to a ceasefire. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin’s comments, following the expiry of a 30-hour Easter truce – which each side accused the other of violating – meant he was open to direct talks. “When the president said that it was possible to discuss the issue of not striking civilian targets, including bilaterally, the president had in mind negotiations and discussions with the Ukrainian side,” said Peskov, quoted by Russia’s Interfax news agency. While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy did not respond directly to Putin’s proposal, he signalled in his nightly video address that Ukraine was “ready for any conversation” about a ceasefire that would stop attacks on civilians.

In January 2023, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) declared the TRF a “terrorist organisation” under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for propaganda on terror activities, recruitment of terrorists, infiltration of terrorists and smuggling of weapons and narcotics from Pakistan into Jammu and Kashmir, reports indianexpress. The move had come months after TRF issued threats to journalists in Kashmir. According to a notification issued by the MHA then, TRF came into existence in 2019 as a proxy outfit of LeT. “TRF is recruiting youth through online medium for furtherance of terrorist activities and has been also involved in carrying out propaganda on terror activities, recruitment of terrorists, infiltration of terrorists and smuggling of weapons and narcotics from Pakistan into J&K. TRF is involved in psychological operations on social media platforms for inciting people of J&K to join terrorist outfits against the Indian state,” the notification said. TRF was a new name given by Pakistan to LeT, officials said. “Lashkar and Jaish-e-Mohammad had religious connotations and Pakistan did not want that.

The verified @Israel account on social media platform X published a message that read: “Rest in Peace, Pope Francis. May his memory be a blessing,” accompanied by an image of the Pope during a 2014 visit to the Western Wall in Jerusalem. The post was removed shortly after it went live. The Jerusalem Post quoted officials at the foreign ministry as saying that the pope had made “statements against Israel” and that the social media post had been published in “error”. Francis, who died on Monday aged 88, suggested last November that the global community should study whether Israel’s military campaign in Gaza constitutes a genocide of the Palestinian people, in some of his most explicit criticism yet of Israel’s conduct in its war with Hamas that began in October 2023. In January the pope also called the humanitarian situation in Gaza ‘shameful’, prompting criticism from Rome’s chief Jewish rabbi who accused Francis of “selective indignation”. Israel says accusations of genocide in its Gaza campaign are baseless and that it is solely hunting down Hamas and other armed groups. Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who leads a far-right coalition of religious and nationalist parties, has not commented on the pope’s death. Francis in 2014 visited the Western Wall, the most sacred prayer site in Judaism, and also prayed at a section of a wall built by Israel in the occupied West Bank dividing Jerusalem and Bethlehem.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111857,Rohingya crisis may affect stability in entire region: Chief Adviser,2025-04-23,"Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus has said the prolonged Rohingya crisis may affect the security and stability in the entire Asia region, calling for working collectively towards lasting solutions to the crisis. The chief adviser said this while addressing a high-level roundtable titled ‘Social and Environment Challenges Around Forcibly Displaced Populations-The Case of the Rohingya’ at Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Doha on Wednesday. In his speech, Prof Yunus said prolonged stay of the Rohingyas poses enormous challenges to Bangladesh and making these Rohingyas frustrated. He observed that rise in criminal activities in the refugee camps in Bangladesh and attempts of illegal migration are clear signs of desperation among them. “If the problem persists further, it may affect the security and stability of the entire region and jeopardise development initiatives,” he added. Unfortunately, the chief adviser said international attention is gradually shifting from the Rohingya crisis due to various conflicts arising at different corners of the globe. He said Qatar can use its good offices to put pressure on Myanmar for starting repatriation of Rohingya people without any further delay. Given the renewed international geopolitical and geostrategic scenario, Qatar can strongly express their solidarity to resolve the issue and be proactive to engage the OIC countries to raise more funds and impose pressure on the international community to advocate for the repatriation of the Rohingyas, he said. The chief adviser said Bangladesh is currently hosting about 1.3 million forcibly displaced Myanmar nationals (Rohingyas), while 32,000 newborns are being added yearly. NativeClick Ads Despite numerous challenges and constraints, he said Bangladesh is giving shelter to such a huge number of Rohingyas only on humanitarian considerations. About the chaotic situation in Myanmar, Prof Yunus said recently, the situation in Rakhine has undergone dramatic changes.

Speaking to a private news channel on Wednesday, Dar said India has failed to provide any evidence linking Pakistan to recent terrorist incidents and appears to be reacting out of anger. “India has not presented any proof regarding the terror incidents. Its announcements reflect a lack of seriousness,” he stated. He added that India’s approach of blaming Pakistan for its internal problems is not new. “India throws the blame on Pakistan whenever it faces a crisis,” he said. Dar confirmed that a National Security Committee (NSC) meeting has been convened for Thursday to formulate Pakistan’s official response. “India’s statements are inappropriate, and the NSC will issue a comprehensive response,” he noted. He also criticised India’s recent diplomatic moves as hasty and emotionally driven: “It is not appropriate to vent anger over terrorism in this way.” The remarks come amid escalating tensions following India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty and expulsion orders issued to Pakistani nationals.

The Prime Minister was in Bihar's Madhubani for a government event. He started his address with a silent tribute to those killed in the Pahalgam terror attack. Later in his address, he said the entire country is in pain because of the ruthless manner in which terrorists killed innocent tourists in Pahalgam. ""The whole country is with the bereaved families. The government is trying its best to ensure the well-being of those injured. Someone has lost a son, someone has lost a brother, someone has lost life partner. Someone spoke Bengali, someone spoke Kannada, someone was Marathi, someone was Odia, someone was Gujarati and someone was Bihar's son. ""From Kargil to Kanyakumari, there is grief and rage. This attack was not just on innocent tourists the country's enemies have shown the audacity to attack India's soul,"" the Prime Minister said. The Prime Minister said the terrorists who carried out the attack and those who plotted it would ""get a punishment they cannot imagine"". ""The time has come to raze whatever is left of the terror haven. The will of 140 crores will break the back of the masters of terror,"" he said, his words directed at Pakistan, which is known to have backed acts of terror on Indian soil. Shifting to English, clearly to send a message across the globe, the Prime Minister said, ""I say to the whole world. India will identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backers. We will pursue them to the ends of the earth. India's spirit will never be broken by terrorism. Terrorism will not go unpunished. Every effort will be made to ensure that justice is done. The entire nation is firm in this resolve. Everyone who believes in humanity is with us. I thank the people of various countries and their leaders who have stood with us in this time,"" he said.

Pakistan took the decisions on Thursday as tit-for-tat retaliatory actions ramp up between the two powers after an attack in Kashmir that killed 26 people. The victims were mostly Indian tourists who had been visiting Pahalgam, a popular tourist destination in the Indian-held part of the territory, which both nuclear-armed nations claim as their own. In response to the attack, India closed a border crossing, suspended a water-sharing treaty and downgraded diplomatic ties with Pakistan - which it blames for the assault. The Indian government did not publicly produce any evidence connecting the attack to its neighbour, but said it had ""cross-border"" links to Pakistan. Pakistan has denied the accusations and a previously unknown militant group calling itself Kashmir Resistance has claimed responsibility. On Thursday, India's foreign ministry said all visas issued to Pakistani nationals would be revoked, effective from Sunday. It also advised Indian citizens not to travel to Pakistan and announced other measures including cutting the number of diplomatic staff and closing the only functional land border crossing between the nations. In return, Pakistan said it was closing its airspace to all Indian-owned and operated airlines and suspending all trade with India - including to and from any third country. NativeClick Ads As a result of the airspace closure, Air India announced that flights to the UK, as well as to North America, Europe and the Middle East, would be forced to take an alternative longer route.

The security forces ""effectively responded"" to the Pakistan Army, they said, adding that there were no casualties. “There were incidents of small arms firing at some places along the LoC initiated by Pakistan last night. The firing was effectively responded to,” sources said. The exchange of fire took place days after a terror attack on tourists in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam sparked a new crisis between the two neighbours. India has hit Pakistan with a series of strict measures, including expulsion of Pakistani military attaches, suspension of the over six-decade-old Indus Water Treaty and immediate shutting down of the Attari land-transit post, in view of the ""cross-border links"" to Tuesday's Pahalgam terror attack, that left 26 people, including a Nepali national, dead. India on Thursday also formally notified Pakistan that the decision to indefinitely suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, signed in 1960, comes into effect immediately. A letter from the Union Ministry of Water Resources to Syed Ali Murtuza, Secretary in the Ministry of Water Resources of Pakistan, said, ""The obligation to honour a treaty in good faith is fundamental to a treaty. However, what we have seen instead is sustained cross-border terrorism by Pakistan targeting the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir"". ""These changes include significantly altered population demographics, the need to accelerate the development of clean energy and other changes in the assumptions underlying the sharing of waters under the Treaty,"" the letter, which came shortly after Pakistan threatened to suspend all agreements between the two countries, including the Simla pact of 1972, which validates the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, read. NativeClick Ads India said in addition, consistent cross-border terrorism has given rise to ""uncertainties' that have ""directly impeded India's full utilization of its rights under the Treaty"". ""Furthermore, apart from other breaches committed by it, Pakistan has refused to respond to India's request to enter into negotiations as envisaged under the Treaty and is thus in breach of the Treaty,"" the letter read. The decision to put the Indus water agreement on hold was announced on Wednesday after a meeting of the Cabinet Committee of Security chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has vowed that India will ""identify, track and punish"" every terrorist and their ""backers"" who were behind the Pahalgam attack.

The deal is reportedly in the works in advance of a planned trip by US President Donald Trump to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates next month, Reuters reported on Thursday. Top defence contractors such as Lockheed Martin, RTX Corp, Boeing, Northrop Grumman and General Atomics are reported to be involved in the supply of advanced weapons systems. Several executives from the companies are expected to join Trump’s delegation for the visit. The sources say the contractor could see Riyadh supplied with a range of weapons including C-130 transport aircraft, missiles and radar systems. It is unlikely, however, that Saudi Arabia will gain access to Lockheed Martin’s F-35 fighter jet. Only a select number of countries can buy F-35s from the US, such as NATO allies, Japan, South Korea and Australia. Trump’s predecessor, President Joe Biden, tried unsuccessfully to sign a new defence pact with Saudi Arabia with the broader aim of normalising relations with Israel. Biden’s pact also called for Riyadh to restrict Chinese investment and halt arms purchases from Beijing, but Reuters said it could not establish whether Trump’s proposed deal would call for similar restrictions.

The minister made the comments after attending a meeting chaired by home minister Amit Shah to discuss the future course of action following India’s decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 with Pakistan. Besides Paatil, senior officials from several ministries reportedly attended the high-stakes meeting. Paatil also said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has issued a slew of directives, and the meeting was held to follow up on them. Shah also made several suggestions to ensure the effective implementation of the Centre’s decision. Paatil later posted on X, “The Modi government’s historic decision on the Indus Waters Treaty is lawful and in national interest. We will ensure that not a single drop of Indus water flows into Pakistan.” The BJP leader also said India has sent a “strong message” to Pakistan that it will not tolerate terrorism at all.

This comes as tensions soared between the two neighbouring countries after both took multiple actions after the terror attack. Donald Trump, while speaking to reporters on Air Force One, said that there is a history of conflict between India and Pakistan over the border region, but did not answer when asked if he would contact the two countries regarding the dispute. “They’ll get it figured out one way or the other,” he said as he travelled aboard his plane. “There’s great tension between Pakistan and India, but there always has been.” 26 civilians were killed and others were left injured after terrorists opened fire on a group of tourists in Kashmir’s Pahalgam. The Resistance Front (TRF), a proxy of the banned Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), claimed responsibility for the attack. On Thursday, State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce, when asked if Washington is playing any role in de-escalating tensions between India and Pakistan, said, “What I can tell you is, of course, as we all know, it’s a rapidly changing situation and we are monitoring it closely, as you might imagine. And we, of course, are not now taking a position on the status of Kashmir or of Jammu either, so that’s really going to be the extent of what I can say today.” When asked if President Trump had offered to mediate between India and Pakistan during his first term, Bruce said, “I’m not going to be remarking… as I mentioned.” On Wednesday, Donald Trump strongly condemned the terror attack in Pahalgam in a phone call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and expressed full support to India to bring to justice the perpetrators of the “heinous attack.” NativeClick Ads (With inputs from Reuters, PTI)",trump sai indiapakistan tension,unit state presid donald trump fridai speak pahalgam terror attack fallout say india pakistan will figur solut tension come tension soar two neighbour countri take multipl action terror attack donald trump speak report air forc on say histori conflict india pakistan border region answer ask contact two countri regard disput will get figur on wai say travel aboard plane great tension pakistan india alwai 26 civilian kill other leave injur terrorist open fire group tourist kashmir pahalgam resist front proxi ban pakistanbas lashkaretaiba claim respons attack thursdai state depart spokesperson tammi bruce ask washington plai role deescal tension india pakistan say can tell cours know rapidli chang situat monitor close may imagin cours now take posit statu kashmir jammu either realli go extent can sai todai ask presid trump offer mediat india pakistan first term bruce say go remark mention wednesdai donald trump strongli condemn terror attack pahalgam phone call prime minist narendra modi express full support india bring justic perpetr heinou attack nativeclick ad,unit state presid donald trump fridai speak pahalgam terror attack fallout say india pakistan will figur solut tension come tension soar two neighbour countri take multipl action terror attack donald trump speak report air forc on say histori conflict india pakistan border region answer ask contact two countri regard disput will get figur on wai say travel aboard plane great tension pakistan india alwai 26 civilian kill other leave injur terrorist open fire group tourist kashmir pahalgam resist front proxi ban pakistanbas lashkaretaiba claim respons attack thursdai state depart spokesperson tammi bruce ask washington plai role deescal tension india pakistan say can tell cours know rapidli chang situat monitor close may imagin cours now take posit statu kashmir jammu either realli go extent can sai todai ask presid trump offer mediat india pakistan first term bruce say go remark mention wednesdai donald trump strongli condemn terror attack pahalgam phone call prime minist narendra modi express full support india bring justic perpetr heinou attack nativeclick ad,5,pakistan_india_attack_say,0.19473684210526315,0.06315789473684211,0.06842105263157895,0.07368421052631578,0.3631578947368421,0.03684210526315789,0.09473684210526316,0.031578947368421054,0.02631578947368421,0.04736842105263158

Addressing a large rally in Sukkur, Bilawal declared that the Indus belongs to Pakistan and will remain so, despite New Delhi’s unilateral moves. “Let Modi hear this clearly — the Indus is ours, and it will remain ours. Either our water will flow, or their blood will,” he warned, standing on the banks of the historic river. The PPP chairman strongly condemned India’s decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty following accusations against Pakistan over the recent Pahalgam terror attack. He accused Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of levelling “false and baseless” allegations to cover internal failures and mislead the Indian public. “Whenever there is unrest in Kashmir, India blames Pakistan to distract from its own weaknesses,” Bilawal asserted. He emphasised that India’s unilateral withdrawal from the Indus Waters Treaty, a binding international agreement, would not be recognised either globally or by the people of Pakistan. “Modi’s efforts to take over the Indus will fail. We are the rightful heirs and defenders of the Sindhu (Indus), and we will protect it at all costs,” he said. Bilawal reaffirmed that Pakistan’s armed forces are fully prepared to deliver a strong response to any Indian aggression. “We will confront India bravely, and our forces will give them a fitting reply at the borders,” he said. He urged the people of Pakistan to unite in defending the country’s water rights and sovereignty. “All four provinces must stand together to deliver a strong, united response to Modi’s provocations,” he said, calling on Pakistanis to act as ambassadors of the Indus River and protect their heritage.

Francis died Monday at age 88 after suffering a cerebral stroke that put him into a coma and led to irreversible heart failure. The pope’s casket was closed and sealed Friday by Cardinal Kevin Farrell as part of the next steps in carefully orchestrated rites set off by the death of a pope. The funeral began at 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. EST) in St. Peter’s Square with Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, dean of the College of Cardinals, presiding over it. World leaders, including President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, joined the public in saying farewell. The Vatican said 164 delegations were confirmed, including 54 heads of state and 12 reigning sovereigns. More than 2,500 police officers and 1,500 soldiers are providing security during the funeral, with officials expecting around 200,000 mourners in St. Peter's Square and up to 300,000 people along the 2-mile route from the Vatican to the pope's burial place. Matteo Bruni, the Director of the Holy See Press Office, said the procession with the vehicle carrying the pope's body to St. Mary Major would leave from the Perugino Door to the Vatican and that it would not pass through St. Peter’s Square. NativeClick Ads “The procession toward St. Mary Major will take about half an hour, and the Pope’s coffin will be visible,” he added. The burial will take place in private, according to the Vatican. In keeping with Francis’s embrace of the marginalized, the Vatican said a group of poor and needy people will meet the pope’s coffin to pay homage to him when it arrives at St. Mary Major Basilica for burial. In his final testament, the pope wrote, ""The tomb should be in the ground simple, without particular ornamentation, bearing only the inscription: Franciscus."" On Sunday afternoon, the Cardinals will go to the Marian Basilica, where they will pass through the Holy Door, visit Pope Francis' tomb, and then gather in the Pauline Chapel where the icon of Maria Salus Populi Romani is housed before participating in evening prayers._Agencies",world leader gather pope franci funer,funer mass pope franci take place st peter squar saturdai 250000 mourner visit st peter basilica three dai pai respect franci di mondai ag 88 suffer cerebr stroke put coma lead irrevers heart failur pope casket close seal fridai cardin kevin farrel part next step carefulli orchestr rite set death pope funer begin 10 local time st peter squar cardin giovanni battista re dean colleg cardin presid world leader includ presid donald trump ukrainian presid volodymyr zelenskyi join public sai farewel vatican say 164 deleg confirm includ 54 head state 12 reign sovereign 2500 polic offic 1500 soldier provid secur funer offici expect around 200000 mourner st peter squar 300000 peopl along 2mile rout vatican pope burial place matteo bruni director holi see press offic say process vehicl carri pope bodi st mari major leav perugino door vatican pass st peter squar nativeclick ad process toward st mari major will take half hour pope coffin will visibl ad burial will take place privat accord vatican keep franci embrac margin vatican say group poor needi peopl will meet pope coffin pai homag arriv st mari major basilica burial final testament pope write tomb grind simpl without particular ornament bear inscript franciscu sundai afternoon cardin will go marian basilica will pass holi door visit pope franci tomb gather paulin chapel icon mare salu populi romani hous particip even prayersag,funer mass pope franci take place st peter squar saturdai 250000 mourner visit st peter basilica three dai pai respect franci di mondai ag 88 suffer cerebr stroke put coma lead irrevers heart failur pope casket close seal fridai cardin kevin farrel part next step carefulli orchestr rite set death pope funer begin 10 local time st peter squar cardin giovanni battista re dean colleg cardin presid world leader includ presid donald trump ukrainian presid volodymyr zelenskyi join public sai farewel vatican say 164 deleg confirm includ 54 head state 12 reign sovereign 2500 polic offic 1500 soldier provid secur funer offici expect around 200000 mourner st peter squar 300000 peopl along 2mile rout vatican pope burial place matteo bruni director holi see press offic say process vehicl carri pope bodi st mari major leav perugino door vatican pass st peter squar nativeclick ad process toward st mari major will take half hour pope coffin will visibl ad burial will take place privat accord vatican keep franci embrac margin vatican say group poor needi peopl will meet pope coffin pai homag arriv st mari major basilica burial final testament pope write tomb grind simpl without particular ornament bear inscript franciscu sundai afternoon cardin will go marian basilica will pass holi door visit pope franci tomb gather paulin chapel icon mare salu populi romani hous particip even prayersag,9,advis_chief_bangladesh_yunu,0.12105263157894737,0.12105263157894737,0.05789473684210526,0.15789473684210525,0.05263157894736842,0.04736842105263158,0.03684210526315789,0.042105263157894736,0.3,0.06315789473684211

According to the state-run IRNA news agency, the blast happened at the Rajaei port, a major facility for container shipments for the Islamic Republic that handles some 80 million tonnes of goods a year. Social media videos showed black billowing smoke after the blast. Others showed glass blown out of buildings kilometers away from the epicentre of the explosion. Authorities have offered no cause for the explosion yet. Industrial accidents happen in Iran, particularly at its aging oil facilities that struggle for access to parts under international sanctions. But Iranian state TV specifically ruled out any energy infrastructure as causing or being damaged in the blast. Mehrdad Hasanzadeh, a provincial disaster management official, told Iranian state TV that first responders were trying to reach the area while others were attempting to evacuate the site.

Traveling from around the world, from monarchs to the poor, another 150,000 people gathered along the route from St Peter's to Santa Maria Maggiore, Francis' final resting place, on a mild and sunny day to attend the funeral of the 88-year-old pontiff who died Monday.

U.S. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump were there, as were former President Joe Biden and former First Lady Jill Biden. The Vatican said 400,000 people packed St Peter's Square and lined the streets of Rome for the funeral of the first Latin American leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics.

The poet breathed his last at a retirement home in Germany’s Berlin on Saturday night. His niece Shawonti Haider, an associate professor at the Department of Mass Communication and Journalism at Dhaka University, confirmed the news to the media. Shawonti Haider said: “Uncle died at 9:20pm local time.” After leaving the country in 1974, Daud spent a few years in Kolkata and then went to Germany in 1987. He has lived there ever since.

He was admitted to the ICU at that time. After receiving treatment at the hospital, the poet returned home but did not return to his regular life. Daud was born on February 21, 1952, in Pabna. He was a poet, author and journalist. His poem “Kalo Shurjer Kalo Jyosnai Kalo Bonnyai” was published in the Dainik Sangbad on February 24, 1974. He was then accused in a case over “hurting religious sentiment”. A protest movement broke out against him, and police arrested him on March 11 that year.

The blast occurred on Saturday at the Sina container yard, part of the key Shahid Rajaei port in Bandar Abbas, located more than 1,000 kilometres south of Tehran. Emergency services confirmed the fire was now “under control but not extinguished,” with thick black smoke still rising from the site, according to a state TV correspondent reporting live from the scene. Authorities had initially reported 14 deaths before revising the figure. Most of the injured have been transferred to local hospitals for treatment, officials said. The explosion, which hit the Shahid Rajaee section of the port, occurred as Iran began a third round of nuclear talks with the United States in Oman, but there was no immediate indication of a link between the two events. Hossein Zafari, a spokesperson for Iran’s crisis management organisation, appeared to blame the explosion on poor storage of chemicals in containers at Shahid Rajaee. “The cause of the explosion was the chemicals inside the containers,” he told Iran’s ILNA news agency. “Previously, the Director General of Crisis Management had given warnings to this port during their visits and had pointed out the possibility of danger,” Zafari said.

One person was killed and a 14-year-old girl wounded in the city of Pavlohrad in the Dnipropetrovsk region, which was hit for the third consecutive night, regional Gov. Serhii Lysak said, AP reports. The attacks came hours after Russia claimed to have regained control over the remaining parts of the Kursk region, which Ukrainian forces seized in a surprise incursion last August. Ukrainian officials said the fighting in Kursk was still ongoing. Trump said Saturday that he doubts Putin wants to end the more than three-year war in Ukraine, expressing new skepticism that a peace deal can be reached soon. Only a day earlier, Trump had said Ukraine and Russia were “very close to a deal.” “There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,” Trump wrote in a social media post as he flew back to the United States after attending Pope Francis’ funeral at the Vatican, where he met briefly with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump also hinted at further sanctions against Russia. The Trump-Zelenskyy conversation on the sidelines of the pope’s funeral was the first face-to-face encounter between the two leaders since they argued during a heated Oval Office meeting at the White House in late February. Russia fired 149 exploding drones and decoys in the latest wave of attacks, the Ukrainian air force said, adding that 57 were intercepted and another 67 jammed. One person also was wounded in drone attacks on the Odesa region and another in the city of Zhitomir, according to local officials.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111958,People think interim govt is still a good solution,2025-04-28,"Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus said people think the interim government is still a good solution for them. He made such comment in an interview with Al Jazeera on Sunday (April 27). Next national polls will be held within June 2026, Prof Yunus said in the interview with Al Jazeera’s ‘Talk to Al Jazeera’ event. He also said the timeline will depend on how many reforms all agree or disagree on. If the consensus is on a larger number of reforms, then it will take longer. “If we can focus on a smaller version of the [reform] implementation, then we will have an early election in December,” he said in the interview that was aired yesterday. “However, if the process takes longer, we go up to June, but we will not go beyond June,” he added. Yunus promised that the next election will be best ever election in the country’s history. Asked if the Awami League will be allowed to take part in the polls, Yunus said, “We don't know yet, they [AL] have not declared anything.” NativeClick Ads He said once the declaration comes, then the matter of the response from the Election Commission and other factors will arise. Then there are other parties who may say that under this law they cannot participate and so on, he added. Asked whether the “honeymoon period” for the interim government was over, Yunus said people think the interim government is still a good solution for them. “They’re not saying let the interim government go, have the election today… We have not faced any such problem of people saying that ‘hand it [power] over as soon as possible’,” he added. Asked about ousted PM’s claim that she is still the “rightful prime minister” and how the government viewed her presence in India, he said he had a meeting with Indian PM Narendra Modi during the BIMSTEC Summit in Bangkok. “I made it very clear that, okay if you [Modi] want to keep her that is probably not something that I can settle with you, but definitely while she’s there, she should not be talking because it creates a lot of problems for us. “She’s giving speeches to incite people inside of Bangladesh, and we have to suffer from that,” Yunus added. Asked about Modi's response, Yunus said, “If I recollect, he said this [India] is a country where social media is open to anybody. I cannot control that.” Asked if he thought India was offering Sheikh Hasina political cover, should she face justice back home, Yunus said, “We have already sent a letter to Indian government to send her to Bangladesh. They have not responded yet, but when the legal procedures begin and the court will give the notice …” he added. The anchor then said, “So let me get this straight you’re saying that Prime Minister Modi has told you we can’t do anything about her freedom of speech in a country India that has been accused of stifling freedom of speech and in no way have you been given any kind of guarantees that she will be sent back to face justice?” Yunus said, “no.” On Bangladesh and India relations, Yunus said, “This is one of the cases that we have to resolve ourselves … we understand what their legal situation is, what our legal situation is. But we are waiting for the legal notice from the court.” Asked if Yunus decided to visit China first deliberately before India and whether he was sending a message, Yunus said he was visiting countries where he would like to go. “I tried to go to India, but they didn’t respond to it. So, I went to China, and now I’ll go to Malaysia,” he said. He said he is visiting countries to revive SAARC. Asked if India has given him a cold shoulder, and is he now deepening ties with Pakistan as an alternative, Yunus said, “I will not say cold shoulder. It’s maybe a temporary thing… something we have to resolve together. I’ll not take this as a final thing, it’s not something long-lasting.” Talking about Bangladesh’s relationship with the Trump administration, Yunus said his government has a very good, strong, and warm relationship with the Trump administration. Asked if he saw the US as a reliable partner or was he being forced to choose between Beijing and Washington DC, Yunus said, “No this is not a question of choice, they’re all our friends. The USA is a good friend, China is a good friend, India is a good friend.” Yunus said that foreign governments are helping Bangladesh so that Bangladesh could get back its money laundered

This was the first time that the Pakistan Army violated the ceasefire in the Poonch sector. The exchange of fire between Indian and Pakistani troops started after 26 people were killed in a terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam last Tuesday. Relations between India and Pakistan have soured further after the role of a terror group linked to Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba emerged in the Pahalgam terror attack -- the worst in Jammu and Kashmir since the Pulwama incident. India has hit Pakistan with a series of strict measures, including expulsion of Pakistani military attaches, suspension of the over six-decade-old Indus Waters Treaty and immediate shutting down of the Attari land-transit post. The decisions were taken on Wednesday after a meeting of the Cabinet Committee of Security chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has vowed that India will “identify, track and punish” every terrorist and their “backers” who were behind the deadly attack. Pakistan has also suspended all bilateral pacts with India, including the Simla agreement. NativeClick Ads The police have released sketches of three terrorists suspected of being involved in the Pahalgam attack. According to the notices made public by the police on X, the three suspects are: Hashim Musa alias Suleman and Ali Bhai alias Talha Bhai, both residents of Pakistan, and Adil Hussain Thoker, a native of Anantnag district. They have announced a reward of Rs 20 lakh for credible information leading to their arrest.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111961,North Korea admits sending troops to fight against Ukraine,2025-04-28,"North Korea has confirmed for the first time that it sent troops to Russia to support Moscow’s war against Ukraine, Al Jazeera reports. The country also said that its forces had contributed to taking back Russian territory held by Ukraine’s military in the Kursk region. In a statement provided to North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on Monday, the Central Military Commission of the ruling Workers’ Party said that the country’s leader, Kim Jong Un, had sent troops into combat alongside Russian forces as part of a mutual defence treaty between Moscow and Pyongyang. The KCNA quoted Kim as saying that soldiers were deployed to “annihilate and wipe out the Ukrainian neo-Nazi occupiers and liberate the Kursk area in cooperation with the Russian armed forces”. “They who fought for justice are all heroes and representatives of the honour of the motherland,” KCNA quoted Kim as saying. North Korea “regards it as an honour to have an alliance with such a powerful state as the Russian Federation”, KCNA said. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Kim signed a comprehensive strategic partnership treaty in June last year, committing the two countries to come to each other’s assistance, militarily, in the event of war. According to South Korea’s official Yonhap News Agency, Kim also said that a monument would be built soon in the capital, Pyongyang, to honour those who had fought against Ukraine.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111965,India taking preparations to attack Pakistan,2025-04-28,"Since the horrific terrorist attack in Kashmir last week, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, has spoken on the phone with more than a dozen world leaders. Diplomats from 100 missions in India’s capital have filed into the foreign ministry for briefings, officials said. But the effort is largely not about rallying help to de-escalate India’s dangerous face-off with Pakistan, which it accuses of having “linkages” to the attack. Instead, according to four diplomatic officials aware of the discussions, New Delhi appears to be building a case for military action against its neighbor and archenemy. Without naming Pakistan, Mr. Modi in a speech on Thursday promised severe punishment and the razing of terror safe havens. In an indication of how volatile the situation remains, the security forces of the two sides have exchanged intermittent small-arms fire across the border, Indian officials said on Sunday. One official said the exchange of fire had happened two of the past three nights, while a second official said it was three consecutive nights. In Kashmir, Indian forces have also begun a sweeping clampdown, arresting hundreds, as they continue their hunt for the perpetrators. NativeClick Ads Earlier, India declared its intention to disrupt the flow of water to Pakistan, whose irrigation system depends largely on upstream rivers. It also ordered the immediate departure of some staff members at Pakistan’s diplomatic mission as well as of Pakistani citizens visiting India. Pakistan, for its part, has said it will suspend participation in bilateral treaties, including one that affects the “line of control” demarcating the frontier between the two countries in the disputed areas where a cease-fire had held for several years. Anti-Muslim sentiment in India is also intensifying, with Kashmiri students studying in other Indian cities in particular facing widespread harassment and many of them feeling compelled to return home. Five days after the terrorist assault, in which gunmen killed 26 civilians, India has not officially identified any group as having carried out the massacre, and it has publicly presented little evidence to support its claim that Pakistan was behind it. The Pakistani government has denied involvement. In the briefings to diplomats at the foreign ministry, Indian officials have described Pakistan’s past patterns of support for terrorist groups targeting India, diplomatic officials said. The Indian officials have said their investigation is continuing, and made brief references to technical intelligence tying the perpetrators of last week’s attack to Pakistan, including facial recognition data. The lack of strong evidence offered so far, analysts and diplomats said, pointed to one of two possibilities: that India needs more time to gather information about the terrorist attack before striking Pakistan, or that — in a time of particular chaos on the world stage — it feels little need to justify to anyone the actions it plans to take. A military confrontation between India and Pakistan, both armed with nuclear weapons, runs the risk of rapid escalation that could be difficult to contain. But India is largely unrestrained by any global pressure to limit its response, and it has become quicker to flex its muscles in recent years as its diplomatic and economic power has grown. The governments of Iran and Saudi Arabia have spoken to the two sides, and Iran’s foreign minister has publicly offered to mediate. The United Nations and the European Union have called for restraint and dialogue. But major powers, including the United States, are distracted by other crises, and analysts say India is interpreting the expressions of support by many countries for its pursuit of justice as a green light for any measures it takes. Trump administration officials have voiced strong backing of India’s fight against terrorism. President Trump has said he is friendly with both India and Pakistan, while noting that they have long been at odds. But it is unclear how involved Washington will get in the current clash. Three months into his term, Mr. Trump has still not named an ambassador to India, a sign of where South Asia ranks in his list of priorities.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111968,Walton records Tk 696.44cr profit in July’24-March’25,2025-04-28,"Walton Hi-Tech Industries PLC, country’s leading electrical and electronics manufacturing company listed in capital market, recorded about Tk 696.44 crore net profits during the first nine months (July’2024-March’2025) of the financial year (FY) 2024-25. It was disclosed in the third quarter (Q3) unaudited financial statements of the company for the period ended 31 March, 2025. The report was published after reviewed and approved by the Company's Board of Directors in its 44th meeting held on Sunday (April 27, 2025). The report says, following the post pandemic impact and Russian's invasion of Ukraine, global economy continues to be weakened through significant disruptions in trade, food and fuel price shocks, all of which are contributing to high inflation and subsequent tightening in global financing conditions. Besides, the price hike of material, vulnerable global market condition and devaluation of Bangladesh currency against foreign currencies have increased material cost drastically and also higher inflation rate has been impacted on company's operating cost. In addition, VAT on the supply of refrigerator has been increased to 7.5 percent from 5 percent and also 7.5 percent VAT has been imposed on the supply of air conditioner under the Finance Act 2024. Due to increased cost pressures, the company’s operating profit margin during the July-March period of 2024-2025 declined to 22.09% from 24.73% in the previous year’s same period. In addition, the finance cost as a percentage of sales rose to 7.29% from 6.14%, driven by higher borrowing costs and devaluation of Bangladesh currency against dollar. As a result of these combined economic and political challenges, the net profit after tax for the period ended 31 March, 2025 stood at TK.696.44 crore and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of Tk 22.99 whereas in comparative period ended 31 March, 2024 the net profit after tax was Tk 762.34 crore and EPS was Tk 25.17. As on March 31 of 2025, the Company's Net Asset Value Per Share (NAVPS) stood at Tk 277.04 without revaluation and Tk 378.42 with revaluation. NativeClick Ads The Company’s Net Operating Cash Flows Per Share (NOCFPS) for the period ended 31 March, 2025 stood at Tk 1.83 negative, a decline from Tk 22.88 in the previous period. This decrease is primarily due to a strategic shift in working capital management, whereby payments to suppliers were made using collections from customers rather than bank borrowings. Furthermore, payments to suppliers for goods and services, as well as disbursements to the Government Exchequer for income tax and VAT, increased in line with higher procurement volumes aimed at supporting anticipated sales growth during the current and upcoming peak seasons. These strategic adjustments in cash flow management reflect our long-term commitment to sustainable growth and operational resilience, reinforcing our position in the market. However, the management anticipated that the company’s profits would be healthier in the last quarter (April-June) of the current Financial Year following the peak season of sales. Along with the third quarter financial statements, the Board of the Company also approved the Lithium-Ion Battery Cell Project. The primary objectives of this project are to develop a fully operational sophisticated manufacturing facility capable of producing high quality lithium-ion cells and reducing dependency on imports and providing a competitive, locally manufactured products. Commercial production will be commenced by the mid-2026. As a pioneer in producing lithium-ion battery cell, Walton will not only foster technological innovation and set a benchmark for quality and sustainability but also reduce reliance on imports, create

Luis Montenegro, the prime minister of Portugal, says there is “no indication” that a cyberattack caused the power outage. Spain's government was scrambling to identify the origin of the huge outage, with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez going to the headquarters of the state electricity network operator to be briefed. The operator, Red Electrica, said it would likely take six to 10 hours to restore power in the country and urged people not to speculate as to the cause of the outage. The outage has led to significant disruptions, affecting traffic lights, halting transport networks and leaving hospitals without electricity. Images posted on social media showed metro stations plunged into darkness, with trains halted, and people in offices and hallways using the light on their phones to see. Journalists in Madrid and Barcelona saw people coming out into the streets, holding their smartphones up to try to connect to a network. People were also trapped in lifts, Spanish media reported.

Calling itself the “victim of cross border terrorism”, India flagged the Pakistan Defence Minister’s “open confession” to training and funding terrorists. Ambassador Yojna Patel, India’s Deputy Permanent Representative at the UN, said his confession was not surprising and it exposed Pakistan as a “rogue state” that has been fuelling global terrorism. “The world can no longer turn a blind eye,” added Ambassador Patel. On the sidelines, on the night of April 28-29, Pakistani troops violated the ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir for the fifth consecutive night. However, the Indian Army responded in a “measured and effective” manner, officials said. The firing took place in areas opposite Kupwara and Baramulla districts, as well as the Akhnoor sector. On Monday, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh briefed Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the security preparedness in Jammu and Kashmir following the Pahalgam terror attack. The meeting came a day after Mr Singh met the Chief of General Staff (CDS) General Anil Chauhan to discuss the key decisions taken up by the military to counter Pakistan following the horrific terrorist attack in Pahalgam. 25 tourists and a Kashmiri local were shot dead in cold blood at Baisaran meadow in Pahalgam on April 22.

Mirroring a theme of the campaign, Carney used his victory speech to claim Trump wanted to “break us, so that America can own us”. “That will never, ever happen,” he said to shouts from the crowd. Carney gave a stark assessment of a world order once defined by an integrated global trading system with the US at the centre, saying such a system was over, and he pledged to reshape Canada’s relationships with other nations. “We are over the shock over American betrayal. But we will never forget the lessons,” he said. Carney praised other party leaders for campaigns that he said had strengthened the country’s democracy. “Let’s put an end to the division and anger of the past. We are all Canadian and my government will work for and with everyone.” Earlier in the evening as results from Canada’s Atlantic provinces and vote-rich Quebec and Ontario came in, supporters at the Liberals’ election night party erupted in cheers as it became clear the party would win. It was not immediately clear if the Liberals would have enough seats for a majority government. If it falls short it would need the support of political rivals to govern. NativeClick Ads After a narrow victory in the previous federal election, the Liberals relied on the leftwing New Democratic party to help it pass legislation. Monday’s vote appeared likely to produce a similar result, with the Liberals and the NDP together holding enough seats to pass legislation. For the Liberals, the win marks a remarkable recovery for a party that was, until recently, on track for electoral devastation. Carney’s predecessor as leader, Justin Trudeau, served as prime minister for nearly 10 years but the twilight of his leadership was marked by repeated threats of mutiny, bitter feuding and a fed-up electorate._The Guardian",canada liber parti secur histor elect win,canada liber parti win 4 term offic cap miracul polit resurrect mark landmark victori former central banker polit novic mark carnei prepar face donald trump mirror theme campaign carnei us victori speech claim trump want break u america can u will never ever happen say shout crowd carnei give stark assess world order defin integr global trade system unit state centr sai system pledg reshap canada relationship nation shock american betray will never forget lesson say carnei prais parti leader campaign say strengthen countri democraci let put end divis anger past canadian governmentern will work everyon early even result canada atlant provinc voterich quebec ontario come support liber elect night parti erupt cheer becam clear parti win immedi clear liber enough seat major governmentern fall short need support polit rival governmentern nativeclick ad narrow victori previou feder elect liber reli leftw new democrat parti help pass legisl mondai vote appear like produc similar result liber ndp togeth hold enough seat pass legisl liber win mark remark recoveri parti recent track elector devast carnei predecessor leader justin trudeau serv prime minist nearli 10 year twilight leadership mark repeat threat mutini bitter feud fedup electorateth guardian,canada liber parti win 4 term offic cap miracul polit resurrect mark landmark victori former central banker polit novic mark carnei prepar face donald trump mirror theme campaign carnei us victori speech claim trump want break u america can u will never ever happen say shout crowd carnei give stark assess world order defin integr global trade system unit state centr sai system pledg reshap canada relationship nation shock american betray will never forget lesson say carnei prais parti leader campaign say strengthen countri democraci let put end divis anger past canadian governmentern will work everyon early even result canada atlant provinc voterich quebec ontario come support liber elect night parti erupt cheer becam clear parti win immedi clear liber enough seat major governmentern fall short need support polit rival governmentern nativeclick ad narrow victori previou feder elect liber reli leftw new democrat parti help pass legisl mondai vote appear like produc similar result liber ndp togeth hold enough seat pass legisl liber win mark remark recoveri parti recent track elector devast carnei predecessor leader justin trudeau serv prime minist nearli 10 year twilight leadership mark repeat threat mutini bitter feud fedup electorateth guardian,7,say_governmentern_parti_nation,0.13368983957219252,0.0374331550802139,0.12834224598930483,0.18716577540106952,0.0855614973262032,0.0748663101604278,0.24064171122994651,0.03208556149732621,0.0374331550802139,0.0427807486631016

The Press Secretary said this while responding to a question of a journalist over reports about the UN ‘humanitarian corridor’ to Rakhine State of Myanmar through Cox's Bazar. “We want to make it categorically clear that the government has not discussed about the so-called humanitarian corridor with the UN or any other entity,” he said. Alam said, “Our position is that should there be an UN-led humanitarian support to the state of Rakhine, Bangladesh would be willing to provide logistics support.” According to UNDP, he said the Rakhine state is facing an acute humanitarian situation. Bangladesh has a stellar record to help countries in times of distress, as exemplified by “our aid to Myanmar” following recent devastating earthquake, he added. “Moreover, we are concerned that persistence of suffering may lead to further inflows of people from Rakhine into Bangladesh, which we cannot afford,” the press secretary warned. He said the interim government also believes that the UN-supported humanitarian aid would help stabilise Rakhine and create conditions for the return of the refuges back to Myanmar. NativeClick Ads Given the present conditions, he said, the only viable route for delivery of aid to Rakhine is through Bangladesh. Bangladesh is agreeable in principle to provide logistics support to the transportation of aid through this route, he added. “However, there has not been a decision on the provision of aid to Rakhine. We are in touch with the concerned parties in this regard. In due course, we will consult relevant stakeholders in Bangladesh,” Alam said. He said as regards the reports of involvement of a major power, “these are pure and unadulterated propaganda”. “We have seen a constant barrage of malicious disinformation spread against Bangladesh in recent months, which is still continuing.

We are no longer dependent on the IMF and the World Bank (WB),” he said while talking to the reporters after two separate meetings on the Advisers Council Committee on Economic Affairs and the Advisers Council Committee on Government Purchase at the Cabinet Division Conference Room at Bangladesh Secretariat on Tuesday. He said IMF had acknowledged the macroeconomic stability of Bangladesh, including the stable state of foreign currency reserves and exchange rate compared to the situation in the last December. While divulging the outcomes of his recent tour to the USA attending the Annual Meetings of the World Bank and the IMF, he said that now in Bangladesh, the macroeconomic stability is far better as the IMF had also recognized it compared to the country’s condition in the last December. “Without receiving any further fund from the IMF, we’ve managed to make stable the foreign currency reserves and the exchange rate. We’ve ensured macroeconomic stability without their support and this is a proof,” he added. Dr Salehuddin said that the international financing institution would not be able to shoulder anything on the country. “They (IMF) told us that they will continue while they have also said that they are arriving to an agreement,” he added. About the upcoming project related support, he said supports are in the pipeline from ADB, the World Bank, NDB, and IsDB. “Regarding project support, we’re not apprehending any problem,” he added. Apart from separating the NBR, the Finance Adviser said that the IMF had earlier suggested for making flexible the foreign exchange market. “But, some issues are there to consider before making it wide open … since it is a major policy tool,” he said.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/112001,India may launch military strike in 36 hours: Pakistan minister,2025-04-30,"Pakistan’s Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar said Islamabad has “credible intelligence” that India intends to launch a military strike within the next 24 to 36 hours, as tensions between the two countries escalate following a deadly attack in Indian-administered Kashmir. In a social media post early on Wednesday, Attaullah Tarar accused India of using last week’s attack in Pahalgam, which killed 26 tourists, “as a false pretext” to potentially strike Pakistan. The minister did not provide any concrete information to back up his claim, and the Indian government did not immediately comment publicly on the allegations. “Any act of aggression will be met with a decisive response. India will be fully responsible for any serious consequences in the region,” Tarar said in the post on X. Pakistani Minister of Defence Khawaja Muhammad Asif also told the Reuters news agency on Monday that a military incursion by India was “imminent”. Islamabad is on high alert but will only use its nuclear weapons if “there is a direct threat to our existence”, Asif said. India’s Ministry of External Affairs did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Reuters news agency on the latest remarks from Tarar. Tensions between the two countries have been rising after India said there were Pakistani elements linked to the attack on April 22 in the mountain resort of Pahalgam. NativeClick Ads It was the deadliest attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir in more than two decades, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised to pursue the attackers. A statement issued in the name of The Resistance Front (TRF), which is believed to be an offshoot of the Pakistani-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, claimed responsibility for the attack. But Islamabad has denied any role in what happened and called for a neutral investigation. After the attack, the neighbours unleashed a raft of diplomatic measures against each other, including visa revocations and the closure of Pakistani airspace to Indian airlines. India also suspended its participation in the Indus Waters Treaty, which regulates water-sharing from the Indus River and its tributaries between the two countries. The move spurred protests in Pakistan, and the Pakistani government has said it is preparing legal action over New Delhi’s decision. Fire also has been exchanged along the Line of Control (LoC), the 740km (460-mile) de-facto border separating Indian- and Pakistani-controlled areas of Kashmir, prompting international calls to de-escalate tensions. On Tuesday, the United States urged the two countries to work towards a “responsible solution”. “We are reaching out to both parties, and telling … them to not escalate the situation,” a Department of State spokesperson told reporters, quoting a statement by Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

A special team has been formed to ascertain the cause of the fire. Kolkata Police Commissioner said the fire broke out around 8.15 pm on the premises of Rituraj Hotel near Falpatti Machhua, news agency ANI reported. There were 60 staff members at the time of the incident, police said. “Fourteen bodies have been recovered and several people have been rescued by the teams,” Verma told reporters, adding that the fire was under control. Police said eight bodies were identified and 13 were injured, of which one was hospitalised and the remaining others were discharged. Ten fire engines brought the blaze under control, but the emergency services faced a tough time operating in the congested area in Burrabazar, where the largest wholesale market in eastern India is located, according to news agency PTI. Several people tried to escape through the windows and narrow ledges of the building during the fire.

Additionally, I appeal for a thorough review and stricter monitoring of fire safety measures to prevent such tragic incidents in the future,” he tweeted.

According to aviation sources, strict monitoring has begun of all foreign airlines operating flights that either transit through or originate from Indian airspace. While Indian airlines remain banned from operating in Pakistan, flights from other international carriers continue under increased scrutiny. Special instructions have been issued to air traffic controllers at all major airports, including Lahore’s Allama Iqbal International Airport. Controllers have been directed to demand air defence clearance numbers from pilots of any suspicious aircraft prior to departure. No aircraft will be cleared without proper documentation and identification. In addition, all airport personnel — including officers and employees from various departments — have been ordered to carry valid departmental ID cards at all times. Individuals without identification are being barred from airport premises as part of the heightened vigilance. Coordination among security agencies such as the Airport Security Force (ASF), police, and other law enforcement bodies has also been strengthened to ensure a seamless response to any potential emergency. Authorities have reaffirmed their commitment to strict enforcement of security protocols, with comprehensive measures now in place to prevent any lapse in safety during this period of regional tension.

The firing, which began with small arms, was reported from the Pargwal sector along the IB in Jammu district, and the Sunderbani and Naushera sectors in Rajouri district. This marked the sixth consecutive night of ceasefire violations by Pakistan along the LoC, amidst heightened tensions between New Delhi and Islamabad following a recent terror attack in Pahalgam on April 22. “On the night of April 29-30, Pakistan Army posts initiated unprovoked small-arms fire across the Line of Control opposite the Naushera, Sunderbani, and Akhnoor sectors in the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir,” a defence spokesperson in Jammu said. The Indian Army troops responded swiftly and proportionately, the spokesperson added. Similar incidents of unprovoked small-arms fire were also reported from Pakistani posts across the LoC in Baramulla and Kupwara districts in the Kashmir Valley, and across the IB in the Pargwal sector.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/112006,Pakistan won’t strike India first: Foreign Minister,2025-04-30,"Pakistan ‘s Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday said the country will not strike India first but reserves the right to retaliate, as he concluded his speech in the Senate on the recent tensions with India and diplomatic overtures deployed by Islamabad to contest New Delhi’s allegations in light of the Pahalgam attack. The Senate session also witnessed a call by PPP lawmaker Syed Masroor Ahsan, who endorsed the idea floated by the PTI seeking the involvement of PTI chief Imran Khan in the multi-party conference to send a “message of unity” in the country. The idea initially floated by PTI’s Ali Zafar was recalled by PTI’s Aon Abbas in his speech on Tuesday, in which he said PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif, PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari, and PTI founder Imran Khan should participate in the moot to send a strong message. PPP’s Masroor Ahsan, while endorsing the idea, observed that the government should show flexibility and listen to the opposition. “Both sides need to set aside egos,” he remarked. Earlier, at least three senators, Allama Nasir Abbas, Gurdeep Singh and Dost Muhammad, called for the release of Imran Khan from the Adiala jail. However, PML-N Senator Nasir Butt said Imran Khan would have to face the law and prove his innocence to secure his freedom. Senator Saifullah Abro of the PTI chided former prime minister Nawaz Sharif for his purported silence over the Pahalgam attack and demanded that the political leadership make strong statements over the issue. Stern response Meanwhile, FM Ishaq Dar said Pakistan would pay back India in the same coin, but it would not initiate an attack. NativeClick Ads Sharing details of Pakistan’s diplomatic overtures following the escalation in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack, he said foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, China, the United Kingdom, Turkiye, Azerbaijan, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Hungary have been taken on board about Pakistan’s concerns. He said he also spoke directly to the prime minister of Qatar. Mr Dar praised China and Turkiye for expressing clear support for Pakistan in the wake of the crisis. “I walked them through what happened — India’s psyche, its history and our concerns about what intentions it may have in light of that history,” he told the House. Mr Dar said intelligence reports suggest that India was contemplating some form of escalation. Referring to the 2019 Pulwama attack that killed 40 Indian paramilitary personnel and was blamed on a Pakistan-based militant group, the deputy prime minister noted that New Delhi had used the incident as a pretext to revoke Article 370 of its constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir. The region was subsequently absorbed into India’s union territory framework, a move Pakistan has repeatedly condemned. Ishaq Dar also said that India had been attempting to alter the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, which determined the water-sharing mechanism between both countries, for the past two years, citing changing circumstances. “I have my doubts, much like other people, that this drama was staged to suspend this treaty,” he said while referring to the Pahalgam attack. He said there was no evidence that it was a false-flag operation. “What we do say with full confidence is that Pakistan has nothing to do with this [attack].” According to Mr Dar, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif offered an independent investigation into the Pahalgam attack fully knowing that Pakistan had nothing to do with it. He also made it clear that any meddling with Pakistani waters by India will not be tolerated at any cost and will be taken as an act of war.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/112007,Ramna Batamul bomb attack: HC verdict on May 8,2025-04-30,"The High Court has set May 8 to deliver verdict on the death references, appeals and jail appeals of the convicts in the much-talked Ramna Batamul blast case. The HC bench of Justice Mostafa Zaman Islam and Justice Nasrin Akter issued the order on Wednesday (April 30). Senior lawyers SM Shahjahan, Sarwar Ahmed and Mohammad Shishir Monir stood for the accused while Deputy Attorney General Sultana Akter Rubi represented the state during the hearing in the court. On April 14, 2001, during the Chhayanat’s Bengali New Year celebrations at Ramna Batamul, a bomb blast left ten people dead. Two cases—one for murder and another for explosives—were filed with Ramna Police Station after the incident.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/112009,US to hold talks to ease India-Pakistan tensions,2025-04-30,"Amid escalating tensions between Pakistan and India following the IIOJK attack, the United States has stepped in diplomatically, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio set to speak with the foreign ministers of both nations to encourage restraint and prevent further escalation. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Washington is urging both sides to de-escalate. “We are reaching out to both parties and telling, of course, them to not escalate the situation,” Tammy Bruce told the reporters. “Secretary Rubio believes diplomacy must take the lead,” Bruce said, noting that the Secretary has also encouraged other national leaders and foreign ministers “to reach out to the countries on this issue.” Tensions have surged between the two nuclear-armed neighbours following an attack in Pahalgam, located in Indian-Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir. The attack, which occurred on April 22, claimed the lives of 26 people, mostly tourists, making it one of the deadliest incidents in the region since the year 2000. On April 23, India unilaterally suspended the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), a critical water-sharing agreement brokered by the World Bank, which has held steady through numerous conflicts between the two countries. The next day, Pakistan retaliated by threatening to put the 1972 Simla Agreement in abeyance and closing its airspace to Indian flights. NativeClick Ads India has suggested that cross-border links may have been involved in the attack, although it has not provided concrete evidence. In contrast, Pakistan has strongly denied any involvement. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called for an independent investigation into the incident to determine the truth. Meanwhile, Information Minister Atta Tarar warned late Tuesday that Islamabad has credible intelligence indicating India may launch a military strike within the next 24 to 36 hours, using the recent Pahalgam attack as a pretext. The minister criticised India’s approach, accusing it of assuming a “self-assigned role of judge, jury and executioner” in the region, which was labelled as reckless and destabilising. “Pakistan has itself suffered immensely from terrorism and understands the pain and consequences of such violence,” the statement added, reaffirming Islamabad’s call for restraint and regional peace.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/112017,About 600 North Korean soldiers killed in war in Ukraine,2025-04-30,"About 600 North Korean soldiers have been killed fighting in Russia’s war in Ukraine, South Korean lawmakers have said, citing intelligence officials, reports Aljazeera. Speaking after a closed-door briefing by the National Intelligence Service (NIS) on Wednesday, Lee Seong-kweun and Kim Byung-kee told reporters that an estimated 4,700 North Koreans had been killed or injured so far in the war. Lee and Kim, who co-chair the legislature’s intelligence committee, made their comments two days after Pyongyang confirmed for the first time that it had sent troops to Russia to support Moscow’s war. In a report by the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on Monday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was quoted as saying he had ordered the deployment of troops to “annihilate and wipe out the Ukrainian neo-Nazi occupiers and liberate the Kursk area in cooperation with the Russian armed forces”. The latest casualty figures mark a significant jump from the NIS’s briefing to lawmakers in January, when the spy agency reportedly said that about 300 North Korean troops had been killed in the conflict. In their briefing to reporters, Lee and Kim, members of the conservative People Power Party and liberal Democratic Party, respectively, said that the NIS estimates that Pyongyang has deployed about 15,000 soldiers in total. The lawmakers also said that Pyongyang appears to have received technical assistance on spy satellites in return for its assistance, as well as drones, electronic warfare equipment and SA-22 surface-to-air missiles._Agencies.",600 north korean soldier kill war ukrain,600 north korean soldier kill fight russia war ukrain south korean lawmak say cite intellig offici report aljazeera speak closeddoor brief nation intellig servic wednesdai lee seongkweun kim byungke tell report estim 4700 north korean kill injur far war lee kim cochair legislatur intellig committe make comment two dai pyongyang confirm first time send troop russia support moscow war report offici korean central new agenc mondai north korean leader kim jong un quot sai order deploy troop annihil wipe ukrainian neonazi occupi liber kursk area cooper russian arm forc late casualti figur mark signific jump ni brief lawmak januari spy agenc reportedli say 300 north korean troop kill conflict brief report lee kim member conserv peopl power parti liber democrat parti respect say ni estim pyongyang deploi 15000 soldier total lawmak also say pyongyang appear receiv technic assist spy satellit return assist good drone electron warfar equip sa22 surfacetoair missilesag,600 north korean soldier kill fight russia war ukrain south korean lawmak say cite intellig offici report aljazeera speak closeddoor brief nation intellig servic wednesdai lee seongkweun kim byungke tell report estim 4700 north korean kill injur far war lee kim cochair legislatur intellig committe make comment two dai pyongyang confirm first time send troop russia support moscow war report offici korean central new agenc mondai north korean leader kim jong un quot sai order deploy troop annihil wipe ukrainian neonazi occupi liber kursk area cooper russian arm forc late casualti figur mark signific jump ni brief lawmak januari spy agenc reportedli say 300 north korean troop kill conflict brief report lee kim member conserv peopl power parti liber democrat parti respect say ni estim pyongyang deploi 15000 soldier total lawmak also say pyongyang appear receiv technic assist spy satellit return assist good drone electron warfar equip sa22 surfacetoair missilesag,1,state_unit_say_trump,0.25,0.08333333333333333,0.07051282051282051,0.07692307692307693,0.1987179487179487,0.07051282051282051,0.057692307692307696,0.05128205128205128,0.04487179487179487,0.09615384615384616

Trump’s choice of Michigan was a recognition not only of how the battleground state helped propel him to victory over Vice-President Kamala Harris in last November’s election, but its status as a potential beneficiary of a tariffs policy which, he claims, will revive US manufacturing. But the cavernous sports and expo centre in the city of Warren, near Detroit, was only half full for the rally, and a steady stream of people left before the end of his disjointed and meandering 89-minute address. “We’re here tonight in the heartland of our nation to celebrate the most successful first 100 days of any administration in the history of our country!” Trump declared. “In 100 days, we have delivered the most profound change in Washington in nearly 100 years.” The 45th and 47th president falsely accused the previous administration of engineering massive border invasion and allowing gangs, cartels and terrorists to infiltrate communities. “Democrats have vowed mass invasion and mass migration,” he said. “We are delivering mass deportation.” Trump defended his use of the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 wartime authority that allows the president to detain or deport the citizens of an enemy nation, to expel foreign terrorists from the US as quickly as possible.

In the April 22 attack, the Islamist assailants segregated men, asked their names and targeted Hindus before shooting them at close range in the Pahalgam area, killing 26 people, officials and survivors said. India has identified the three attackers, including two Pakistani nationals, as ""terrorists"" waging a violent revolt in Muslim-majority Kashmir. Islamabad has denied any role and called for a neutral investigation. Hindu-majority India accuses Islamic Pakistan of funding and encouraging militancy in Kashmir, a Himalayan territory claimed by both nations but ruled in part by them. Islamabad says it only provides moral and diplomatic support to a Kashmiri demand for self-determination. The old rivals, born out of the partition of British colonial India in 1947, have taken measures against each other since the attack, with India putting the critical Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance and Pakistan closing its airspace to Indian airlines. Pakistan's government said it had ""credible intelligence"" that India intends to carry out military action against it in the ""next 24-36 hours on the pretext of baseless and concocted allegations of involvement in the Pahalgam incident"". India's foreign and defence ministries did not respond to requests for comment.

The two countries signed the accord in Washington after months of sometimes fraught negotiations, with uncertainty persisting until the last moment with word of an eleventh-hour snag. The accord establishes a joint investment fund for Ukraine's reconstruction as Trump tries to secure a peace settlement in Russia's three-year-old war in Ukraine. The agreement is central to Kyiv's efforts to mend ties with Trump and the White House, which frayed after he took office in January. Ukrainian officials have hoped that the deal would ensure continued U.S. support for Ukraine's defence against Russia. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Ukrainian First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko were shown signing the agreement in a photo posted on X by the Treasury, which said the deal ""clearly signals the Trump Administration's commitment to a free, sovereign, prosperous Ukraine."" Svyrydenko wrote on X that the accord provides for Washington to contribute to the fund. ""In addition to direct financial contributions, it may also provide NEW assistance - for example air defense systems for Ukraine,"" she said. Washington did not directly address that suggestion. The U.S. has been Ukraine's single largest military donor since Russia's 2022 invasion with aid of more than 64 billion euros ($72 billion), according to the Kiel Institute in Germany.

Inter stunned the hosts with a goal inside 30 seconds-Marcus Thuram cleverly backheeling home the fastest goal ever scored in a Champions League semi-final. Denzel Dumfries doubled the lead in the 21st minute with an acrobatic volley from a corner, putting the visitors in firm control, reports indiatoday. But Barcelona's teenage sensation Lamine Yamal sparked the comeback just three minutes later with a brilliant solo effort from the right, becoming the youngest player ever to score in a Champions League semi-final at 17 years and 291 days, breaking Kylian Mbappe's previous record. Yamal nearly equalised moments later when he struck the post, but Ferran Torres made it 2-2 before half-time with a composed finish after a Raphinha knock-down. Inter regained the lead in the 64th minute through Dumfries, who headed in his second of the night from another corner.

However, the time has changed nowadays. Farmers are using various types of modern machines to harvest rice. As a result, both labor and money are being saved for the farmers. However, agricultural workers are becoming unemployed. They are forced to abandon their ancestral profession and choose other professions. Md Mokbul Mia, a dweller in Ghagra village of Mithamain upazila, left his paddy harvesting profession three years ago. He is now a driver of auto rickshaw in the district. Like the Mokbul Mia, many other paddy harvesting workers left their farming profession. Some of these people have become rickshaw puller, tea stall owner, street food seller instead of farmer. It takes a lot of time to harvest one bigha of paddy using the traditional method. Many workers are also needed to carry and thresh the crops after harvest. Around six to seven workers are needed to for the task. Even, at least Tk7,000-Tk8,000 is required as wage for the workers. However, using modern equipment for this task takes less time and money. District Workers' Union General Secretary Md. Khorshed Uddin said, ""People's professions are changing. We choose different professions to keep up with the times.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with top officials from both countries on Wednesday, asking them to “maintain peace and security in South Asia.” He told Pakistan’s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, of the need to condemn the attack and re-establish direct communications, according to a statement from the State Department. Rubio also spoke with India’s External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar. Relations between the nuclear-armed nations and longtime adversaries have rapidly deteriorated in the wake of the attack, which India and the US have called an act of terrorism. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has accused Pakistan of involvement and vowed to punish those responsible. Pakistan has denied any links to the assault and warned of retaliation if India takes military action. Jaishankar said in an X post Thursday that he discussed the attack in Kashmir with Rubio on April 30. “Its perpetrators, backers and planners must be brought to justice,” he said. In a televised address early on Wednesday, Pakistani Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said his country had “credible intelligence” that India would carry out military action in the next 24 to 36 hours. Hours later at a news conference, Pakistan’s military spokesman, Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, said the country’s response to any Indian aggression will be “befitting and decisive.” Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, speaking at a joint briefing with Chaudhry, reiterated that Pakistan had “nothing” to do with the attack and demanded an “independent and transparent probe by the neutral investigators.” “Pakistan will not be the first one to resort to any escalatory move,” Dar added. “In case of any escalatory move by the Indian side, we will respond very strongly,” he added. On Thursday, Sharif’s advisor on political affairs, Rana Sana Ullah Khan said Pakistan is ready to join a probe by Indian officials into the attack during an interview with Geo News. “A war between two nuclear powers doesn’t end in victory or defeat for either side but on destruction of both nations,” he said. NativeClick Ads Modi gave India’s armed forces a free hand to decide on the timing, targets and mode of responding to the assault in a meeting that included Defense Minister Rajnath Singh and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, the Economic Times reported Tuesday, citing people it didn’t identify.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/112037,India issues high alert along Bangladesh border,2025-05-01,"Amid ongoing tensions with Pakistan following the Pahalgam terror attack, intelligence agencies and security forces have been asked to maintain a high alert along the borders with Bangladesh and Myanmar, reports indiatoday. The agencies have been told to be extra-vigilant along the Bangladesh border in view of the actions by the Muhammad Yunus-led government and the increasing presence of Pakistan's ISI and Pakistani military officials there. Pakistan is likely to use these radical elements, who have a support base in Indian areas bordering Bangladesh, to create trouble for India in case hostilities erupt between the two nations. Indian agencies have been actively monitoring the situation along the Bangladesh border post the riots in Bengal's Murshidabad during protests over the Waqf law. The violence in Murshidabad district, which borders Bangladesh, left three dead and hundreds injured. A report submitted to the Centre said that Bangladeshi miscreants stoked the violence.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/112038,CA Press Wing debunks Tania Amir`s statements over BDR mutiny,2025-05-01,"The Chief Adviser's Press Wing has said the statements by Tania Amir over the 2009 Bangladesh Rifles mutiny are misleading ones, claiming these remarks reflect her own political agenda as a supporter of the deposed Awami League regime. “The statements by Tania Amir about the 2009 Bangladesh Rifles mutiny, which are circulating on social media, reflect her own political agenda as a supporter of the deposed Awami League regime rather than the reality of actions by the Interim Government, which is moving with energy unseen 16 years since the tragedy occurred to ensure justice is done,” the press wing said in a statement on Thursday. The press wing's statement was posted on its verified Facebook page - CA Press Wing Facts. The press wing presented the initiatives that interim government has taken to uncover the truth behind the barbaric carnage. Following are the initiatives: Investigation Commission On December 22, 2024, the government formed a seven-member National Independent Investigation Commission to reexamine the Pilkhana massacre. Chaired by retired Maj. Gen. ALM Fazlur Rahman, the commission has collected testimony from dozens of witnesses (about 37 so far, including officers, BDR personnel and victims' families). It has vowed to ""uncover the true nature of the incident,"" identify all culprits, and even probe any domestic or foreign conspiracies. On April 18, 2025 the commission issued a public notice asking anyone with reliable information or testimony about the 2009 carnage to submit it via its website or email, promising confidentiality. Pledge to Uncover Truth NativeClick Ads Home Affairs Adviser Jahangir Alam Chowdhury reaffirmed the government's commitment to a full reinvestigation of the Pilkhana events. In late February 2025, Commission Chairman Fazlur Rahman told reporters that the inquiry commission had already recorded evidence from dozens of witnesses and that it would call even top figures (e.g. then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and former Army Chief Moeen U Ahmed) as needed. He stressed that the investigation would ""uncover the true nature"" of the incident, include the real perpetrators in the cases, and examine all possible foreign or domestic plots. Public Appeal for Information On April 18, 2025 the Commission publicly invited any citizens or organisations with relevant information to come forward via its website or email. It highlighted the complexity of investigating a 16-year-old crime and assured confidentiality for informants. This suggests an official effort to be transparent and thorough, contrasting with claims that the government is covering things up. Court Cases and Releases In January 2025, hundreds of former BDR personnel were granted bail in mutiny-related cases. Contrary to Amir's allegation that they were set free with no legal procedures, the prisoners were released on bail. Families of the slain officers’ immediately protested that those who massacred army officers should not be freed wholesale. Meanwhile, survivors' families have filed new complaints (e.g. with the International Crimes Tribunal) and threatened fresh protests if justice is not secured. Victims' Memorialisation The interim government has simultaneously taken steps to honour the victims. In March 2025, the Cabinet Division officially declared Feb 25 as ""National Martyred Army Day,"" and accorded ""martyr"" status to the 57 army officers slain at Pilkhana. The press wing said Amir's affiliation with the Awami League is well known. In November 2023, she and her father, Barrister M Amir-ul Islam, collected nomination papers from the ruling Awami League for parliamentary constituencies Kushtia-3 and Kushtia-4, indicating active political engagement with the party. “Her family background is closely tied to the Awami League's legacy: her father was instrumental in drafting Bangladesh's declaration of independence and constitution, and the family has historically supported the Awami League. Although she has taken legal cases independently, she is widely seen as aligned with the party's political and ideological positions.” Given this affiliation, her recent remarks at the Geneva Press Club criticising the Interim Government and insinuating that it represents terrorists and mutineers involved in the 2009 BDR mutiny can be understood as politically motivated, the statement said. Notably, it said, Amir and other speakers at the Geneva conference did not cite any new evidence rather, they replayed claims (e.g. death tolls, indemnity laws, prisoner releases) that have circulated among opposition groups for years. “The Geneva press event is part of a diaspora-driven campaign to keep the spotlight on alleged abuses by Bangladesh's authorities and appears timed to capitalise on this attention and to project a narrative of government impunity to Western audiences. The timing coincided with the government's own steps (March 2025) to honour the mutiny's victims and call for justice,” the statement read. It claimed that Tania Amir and allies seized this moment to pitch a negative storyline that might resonate with international fears of militant Islam. The reality is that the interim government will continue to move on several fronts to ensure justice is finally done in this murky case that horrified Bangladeshis when it occurred and has divided public opinion ever since, according to the statement.",ca press wing debunk tania amir statement bdr mutini,chief advis press wing say statement tania amir 2009 bangladesh rifl mutini mislead on

Reiterating the interim government’s firm determination to build a new Bangladesh, Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus urged the workers and owners to work together to build the new Bangladesh. “The new Bangladesh could not be built if the condition of workers remains the same - that was in old Bangladesh,” he said. Prof Yunus said the aspiration of building the new Bangladesh is “our responsibility and at the same time, a big opportunity”, noting that such aspiration was not created in the country in the past. Highlighting the proposals of the Labour Reform Commission, he said it will be quite impossible to build the new Bangladesh without implementing these proposals. The Chief Adviser stressed implementing the recommendations of the Labour Reform Commission, which need to be accomplished immediately. “Later, we will start work to implement the hard proposals,” he said, adding “We have started the journey and it will continue.” Labour and Employment Adviser Brigadier General (retd) Dr M Sakhawat Hussain, Labour Reform Commission chairman Syed Sultan Uddin Ahmed and Country Director of the International Labour Organization (ILO) Bangladesh Tuomo Poutiainen were, among others, spoke at the function with Labour and Employment Secretary AHM Shafiquzzaman in the chair. NativeClick Ads Mentioning that building the new Bangladesh is the responsibility of all, Prof Yunus said the report of the Labour Reform Commission was prepared involving all stakeholders. The nation has no way to implement the recommendations of the commission in building the new Bangladesh, he said the base of new Bangladesh will be established if the proposals of the commissions could be implemented. Recalling the history of the historic May Day, Prof Yunus said in the context of the July uprising, the May Day has come before the nation with a new message. He also remembered with respect those who sacrificed their lives in establishing the rights of labourers, all working people and the workers who martyred in the July uprising. He said Bangladesh is implementing a road map with ILO, a national plan with European Union and an 11-point labour action plan with the US government. Prof Yunus said to ensure the welfare of workers, the interim government has taken various initiatives, including steps to amend the Labour Act 2006. The Chief Adviser also highlighted various government’s initiatives taken to ensure welfare of labourers and protect their rights. He said the labour unrest was significantly reduced in consultation with workers and owners. A recorded speech of ILO Director-General Gilbert F Houngbo was played on the occasion. Earlier, the Chief Adviser distributed awards among the winners in essay, news report and photography competitions. He also distributed cheques of financial assistance to families of five workers.",govt commit ensur fair recognit protect worker ca,chief advis professor muhammad yunu say governmentern commit ensur fair recognit worker social protect say speak function thursdai bangladeshchina friendship exhibit center mark histor mai dai nation occup health safeti dai 2025 reiter interim governmentern firm determin build new bangladesh chief advis professor muhammad yunu urg worker owner work togeth build new bangladesh new bangladesh build condit worker remain old bangladesh say prof yunu say aspir build new bangladesh respons time big opportun note aspir creat countri past highlight propos labour reform commiss say will quit imposs build new bangladesh without implement propos chief advis stress implement recommend labour reform commiss need accomplish immedi late will start work implement hard propos say ad start journei will continu labour employ advis brigadi gener dr be sakhawat hussain labour reform commiss chairman sy sultan uddin ahm countri director intern labour organ bangladesh tuomo poutiainen among other speak function labour employ secretari ahm shafiquzzaman chair nativeclick ad mention build new bangladesh respons prof yunu say report labour reform commiss prepar involv stakehold nation wai implement recommend commiss build new bangladesh say base new bangladesh will establish propos commiss implement recal histori histor mai dai prof yunu say context juli upris mai dai come nation new messag also rememb respect sacrif live establish right labour work peopl worker martyr juli upris say bangladesh implement road map ilo nation plan european union 11point labour action plan unit state governmentern prof yunu say ensur welfar worker interim governmentern take variou initi includ step amend labour act 2006 chief advis also highlight variou governmentern initi take ensur welfar labour protect right say labour unrest significantli reduc consult worker owner record speech ilo directorgener gilbert f houngbo plai occas early chief advis distribut award among winner essai new report photographi competit also distribut chequ financi assist famili five worker,chief advis professor muhammad yunu say governmentern commit ensur fair recognit worker social protect say speak function thursdai bangladeshchina friendship exhibit center mark histor mai dai nation occup health safeti dai 2025 reiter interim governmentern firm determin build new bangladesh chief advis professor muhammad yunu urg worker owner work togeth build new bangladesh new bangladesh build condit worker remain old bangladesh say prof yunu say aspir build new bangladesh respons time big opportun note aspir creat countri past highlight propos labour reform commiss say will quit imposs build new bangladesh without implement propos chief advis stress implement recommend labour reform commiss need accomplish immedi late will start work implement hard propos say ad start journei will continu labour employ advis brigadi gener dr be sakhawat hussain labour reform commiss chairman sy sultan uddin ahm countri director intern labour organ bangladesh tuomo poutiainen among other speak function labour employ secretari ahm shafiquzzaman chair nativeclick ad mention build new bangladesh respons prof yunu say report labour reform commiss prepar involv stakehold nation wai implement recommend commiss build new bangladesh say base new bangladesh will establish propos commiss implement recal histori histor mai dai prof yunu say context juli upris mai dai come nation new messag also rememb respect sacrif live establish right labour work peopl worker martyr juli upris say bangladesh implement road map ilo nation plan european union 11point labour action plan unit state governmentern prof yunu say ensur welfar worker interim governmentern take variou initi includ step amend labour act 2006 chief advis also highlight variou governmentern initi take ensur welfar labour protect right say labour unrest significantli reduc consult worker owner record speech ilo directorgener gilbert f houngbo plai occas early chief advis distribut award among winner essai new report photographi competit also distribut chequ financi assist famili five worker,7,say_governmentern_parti_nation,0.04013377926421405,0.04013377926421405,0.10367892976588629,0.17391304347826086,0.026755852842809364,0.033444816053511704,0.22742474916387959,0.04013377926421405,0.1705685618729097,0.14381270903010032

The national parliament election is very necessary so that no one or group has the desire to continue the power. He said this at a virtual address to a grand rally held at BNP head office in Nayapaltan in the capital on the occasion of the May Day on Thursday. BNP’s affiliated body Jatiyatabadi Sramik Dal organised the rally. BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, BNP Standing Committee members Mirza Abbas, Gayeshwar Chandra Roy and Nazrul Islam Khan, BNP leaders Shamsur Rahman Shimul Biswas and Sultan Salauddin Tuku, Krishak Dal President Hasan Zafir Tuhin, Mohila Dal President Afroza Abbas, Juba Dal President Abdul Monayem Munna, Swechchhasebak Dal President SM Jilani, Sramik Dal Dhaka City South convener Sumon Bhuiyan, among others, spoke. Sramik Dal President Anwar Hossain presided over the rally. Tarique said BNP believes state reforms and elections are equally important, adding the current interim government, despite its legitimate mandate, cannot be an alternative for an elected government. The government must outline its long-term and short-term reform plans, and draft a specific roadmap for holding the next general election only after implementing the necessary reforms. The necessary reforms could be reforms in the law enforcement agencies, the judiciary, and the Election Commission, he suggested. Then, the BNP senior leader referred to the ‘rumours’ that the interim government has granted a humanitarian corridor to Myanmar’s conflict-ridden Rakhine state for aid delivery from Bangladesh. The government did not inform the general people about such a sensitive issue, nor did it feel the need to hold consultations with political parties, which represent the people, over the matter. He declined to start a debate over whether the government can take such decisions without informing the public. But the decision must come from a national parliament elected by the people. This is the norm in every sovereign country, Tarique noted. NativeClick Ads Huge numbers of BNP leaders and activists gathered at Nayapaltan in Dhaka marking rally.

Air India, which has a 26.5% market share in India, flies to Europe, the United States and Canada, often crossing Pakistan's airspace. It operates many more long-haul routes than bigger domestic rival IndiGo. Data from Cirium Ascend shows IndiGo, Air India and its budget unit Air India Express had roughly 1,200 flights combined from New Delhi scheduled for Europe, the Middle East and North America in April. The move, announced by Pakistan is projected to increase operational costs by around Rs 307 crore monthly due to longer flight durations and higher fuel consumption. Air India expects to face around $600 million in additional costs if a ban from Pakistan's airspace lasts for a year, and has asked the federal government to compensate it for the hit. Air India on April 27 asked the Indian government for a subsidy model proportionate to the economic hit, estimating a loss of more than 50 billion Indian rupees ($591 million) for each year the ban lasts, according to a letter sent by the airline to the Civil Aviation Ministry.",air india mai lose 60 crore due pakistan airspac ban,recent closur pakistan airspac indian airlin follow pahalgam terror attack impos signific financi burden indian carrier air india 265 market share india fli europ unit state canada often cross pakistan airspac oper mani longhaul rout big domest rival indigo datum cirium ascend show indigo air india budget unit air india express roughli 1200 flight combin new delhi schedul europ middl east north america april move announc pakistan project increas oper cost around r 307 crore monthli due long flight durat high fuel consumpt air india expect face around 600 million addit cost ban pakistan airspac last year ask feder governmentern compens hit air india april 27 ask indian governmentern subsidi model proportion econom hit estim loss 50 billion indian rupe year ban last accord letter send airlin civil aviat ministri,recent closur pakistan airspac indian airlin follow pahalgam terror attack impos signific financi burden indian carrier air india 265 market share india fli europ unit state canada often cross pakistan airspac oper mani longhaul rout big domest rival indigo datum cirium ascend show indigo air india budget unit air india express roughli 1200 flight combin new delhi schedul europ middl east north america april move announc pakistan project increas oper cost around r 307 crore monthli due long flight durat high fuel consumpt air india expect face around 600 million addit cost ban pakistan airspac last year ask feder governmentern compens hit air india april 27 ask indian governmentern subsidi model proportion econom hit estim loss 50 billion indian rupe year ban last accord letter send airlin civil aviat ministri,5,pakistan_india_attack_say,0.1870967741935484,0.07096774193548387,0.10967741935483871,0.05161290322580645,0.23870967741935484,0.03870967741935484,0.05806451612903226,0.03870967741935484,0.05806451612903226,0.14838709677419354

Despite President Trump’s public stance that President Xi must make the first move, the development represents the latest behind-the-scenes thawing of relations. Trump told his Cabinet on Wednesday that falling cargo flows showed China would soon need to engage. Trump said he was confident he’d speak with Xi. The United States has approached China seeking talks over President Donald Trump's 145% tariffs, potentially signalling Beijing's openness to negotiations. U.S. officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, also expressed hope for progress in easing trade tensions. Hassett told CNBC that there have been ""loose discussions all over both governments"" about the tariffs and China's easing of duties on some U.S. goods last week was a sign of progress. Beijing has made little effort to contain its anger at the tariffs, which it says are tantamount to bullying and cannot stop the rise of the world's second-largest economy. Instead, it has directed its fury at rallying public and global condemnation of the import curbs - showing no interest in a reprieve.

In addition to regular fact-checks, Rumor Scanner published a “Fact File” about old rumors involving Professor Dr Muhammad Yunus that resurfaced during the genocide in Gaza. The Rumor Scanner Investigation Unit also released an investigative report from their team about a new method of spreading political misinformation using Blogspot’s free domain. In the previous month March, 298 false claims were identified. Based on fact-checks published on Rumor Scanner’s website in April, most misinformation (101 items) was related to national issues, making up 34% of the total. There were also 95 political, 38 international, 27 religious, 8 entertainment and literary, 7 education-related, 10 fraud-related, and 9 sports-related false claims found during the month. Most of the misinformation identified last month was based on text, with 138 cases. There were also 105 cases based on videos and 53 based on images. Among all the identified misinformation, 180 were labeled as false, 66 as misleading, and 48 as distorted. Additionally, two sarcastic or humorous posts were fact-checked because they were being shared as if they were real.

In a post on social media, Trump thanked Waltz for his work and said he would be temporarily replaced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who will continue as America's top diplomat. Waltz had faced criticism for mistakenly adding a journalist to a chat group where sensitive military plans were discussed - a political embarrassment likely to feature during confirmation hearings for the UN post. The former Florida congressman is the first senior member of the administration to leave the White House in Trump's second term. Multiple sources told the network he was ousted because of the Signal situation and a perception in the White House that he did not properly vet National Security Council staff, among other reasons. But the sources said Trump respects Waltz so he was given a soft landing and a high-profile new post. However, the BBC spoke to several US officials - who wished to remain anonymous - and they suggested the Trump administration believed Waltz might struggle to be confirmed by the Senate, allowing the president to get rid of him completely without having to fire him. Waltz has been under scrutiny since he acknowledged in March mistakenly adding the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic magazine, Jeffrey Goldberg, to a group chat on Signal with top US security officials.

It marks the second time Israel has struck Syria in as many days, following through on a promise to defend the minority group, which was involved in sectarian violence against Sunni gunmen earlier this week. The Druze adhere to a faith that is an offshoot of Islam and have followers in Syria, Lebanon and Israel. The strikes reflect Israel's deep mistrust of the Sunni Islamists who toppled Bashar al-Assad in December, posing a further challenge to interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa's efforts to establish control over the fractured nation. ""Israel struck last night near the presidential palace in Damascus,"" Netanyahu said in a joint statement with Defense Minister Israel Katz. ""This is a clear message to the Syrian regime: We will not allow (Syrian) forces to deploy south of Damascus or any threat to the Druze community."" The Israeli military said in a statement it struck ""adjacent to the area of the Palace of Ahmed Hussein al-Sharaa in Damascus"", without specifying the target. There was no immediate comment from Syria's authorities.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/112060,Pahalgam attack planned at Lashkar-e-Taiba headquarters: NIA,2025-05-02,"The anti-terror body National Investigation Agency's (NIA) of India preliminary report on the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam's Baisaran Valley points to an operational nexus between Pakistan's intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), and the terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), reports NDTV. According to NIA sources, the conspiracy behind the terror attack that killed 26 people, primarily tourists, was developed within LeT, allegedly under directives issued by senior ISI operatives. The plan is believed to have been formalised at Lashkar's headquarters in Pakistan. Two terrorists central to the attack, identified as Hashmi Musa (alias Suleman) and Ali Bhai (alias Talha Bhai), are confirmed Pakistani nationals. Interrogations of detained operatives indicate that both attackers maintained consistent communication with Pakistani-based handlers, receiving specific instructions on timing, logistics, and execution. The terrorists allegedly entered Indian territory weeks before the attack and were aided by a network of Over Ground Workers (OGWs) who provided local logistical support, including shelter, navigation, and reconnaissance. The NIA has conducted extensive forensic and electronic data gathering. Over 40 cartridges recovered from the crime scene have been sent for ballistic and chemical analysis. Investigators also performed 3D mapping of the attack site and extracted dump data from mobile towers around the valley. Satellite phone activity in the region spiked in the days leading up to the attack. At least three satellite phones were operational in and around Baisaran, and signals from two have been traced and analysed. In total, over 2,800 individuals have been questioned by the NIA and security agencies. As of May 2, more than 150 persons remain in custody for further interrogation. These include both suspected OGWs and individuals with links to banned groups like Jamaat-e-Islami and various factions of the Hurriyat Conference. Raids have been carried out in multiple districts, including Kupwara, Pulwama, Sopore, Anantnag, and Baramulla. The residences of several individuals suspected of aiding cross-border terror infrastructure were searched. NativeClick Ads Searches were conducted at the residence of Mushtaq Ahmad Zargar, alias Latrum, a key figure in the IC-814 hijack case of 1999 and currently believed to be operating from Pakistan.

The rationale for this ban, according to YouTube, was that the channels were propagating “provocative, communally sensitive content and misinformation about India and its security forces.” The Ministry of Home Affairs recommendations that prompted the crackdown, pointed to individual journalists, such as Irshad Bhatti, Asma Shirazi, Umar Cheema and Muneeb Farooq, as targets. India, meanwhile, also sent a warning to the BBC over what it termed as ‘biased reporting’ of the Pahalgam terror incident, objecting to the BBC’s use of the word ‘militants’ to describe the terrorists. The Ministry of External Affairs conveyed its views to BBC India head Jackie Martin formally. India has cancelled visas for a number of Pakistan nationals, followed by a reported 500 plus Pakistan nationals, including diplomats, departing the country using the Attari-Wagah border.

The AIM-120 missiles, whose principal contractor is RTX Corp. in Arizona, are a mainstay of a number of militaries around the world. The missiles are guided by active radar after fired by pilots.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/112078,Polls underway in Australia to elect next PM,2025-05-03,"Australia’s federal election is underway as millions have cast their votes across the country, with a tough contest expected between the ruling center-left Labor Party and opposition center-right Liberal-National Coalition. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and opposition leader Peter Dutton have cast their vote, ABC News reported. The voting will close at 6 pm local time (0800GMT). Earlier on Saturday morning, the polling began at 8 am local time (2200GMT Friday) where more than 18 million Australians are registered to cast ballots under the country’s compulsory voting system. The Australian Electoral Commission said 4.8 million had already voted early by Thursday. Ballots will be counted immediately, but results may not be declared on election night, especially in close contests. Postal votes will be tallied in the following days. The center-left Labor Party, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, is seeking a second term after securing a narrow majority in 2022. NativeClick Ads The main challenger is the center-right Liberal-National Coalition, now led by Peter Dutton. If neither bloc secures 76 seats in the 150-member House of Representatives, the country may again see a minority government, a scenario last seen in 2010. Half of the Senate's 76 seats are also up for grabs. Economic issues have dominated the campaign, with inflation, rising living costs, and housing affordability taking center stage. Political analyst Nathan Fioritti noted that both major parties have struggled to offer substantial solutions. “Support may shift toward smaller players like the Greens, who are proposing more transformative policies,” he said. Fioritti predicted a similar pattern to 2022 when Labor and the Coalition each secured roughly 30% of the vote. “There is growing frustration with the political status quo,” he said. Amid that backdrop, independents and minor parties, particularly the progressive Greens and ""Teal"" independents, could again become power brokers. Seven Teal MPs currently hold seats, having unseated the Liberals in traditionally safe districts by focusing on climate policy and transparency. Campaigns like the Muslim Vote movement are also targeting key marginal seats, especially in response to Australia’s perceived stance on the onslaught in the Gaza Strip. “The issue could influence voters sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, potentially affecting the formation of a minority government,” said Fioritti. While domestic challenges dominate, international concerns are also influencing voter sentiment. US President Donald Trump’s second term has brought unpredictability to global affairs, prompting voters to weigh which party could best manage the Australia-US alliance. Still, experts believe the Trump factor remains a background concern compared to economic matters. “Trump’s shadow is present but not central,” said Charles Miller from the Australian National University. On foreign relations, both major parties are expected to continue Australia’s strategic alignment with the US, while cautiously engaging China on trade. “A softer approach to the US is expected, regardless of the outcome,” said Miller. Voting in Australia is compulsory, with non-participation fined Australian dollars $20 ($13). Since its introduction in 1924, voter turnout has consistently exceeded 90%, making Australia one of the highest-participating democracies in the world.",poll underwai australia elect next

The High Court released the 131-page full verdict on the Supreme Court’s website after it was signed by Justice AKM Asaduzzaman and Justice Syed Enayet Hossain. SM Shahjahan, lawyer for Abrar, confirmed the information on Saturday (May 3). On March 16, the HC upheld the trial court’s verdict confirming the death penalty of 20 BUET students and life imprisonment of five others in the sensational case. Abrar Fahad, a second-year student of BUET’s Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) department, was beaten to death on October 6, 2019, by activists of the Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) at Sher-e-Bangla Hall. The attack was reportedly triggered by a Facebook post Abrar had made about water-sharing issues between Bangladesh and India. His body was later found on the dormitory’s staircase. The following day, Abrar’s father filed a murder case at Chawkbazar Police Station. The incident sparked nationwide outrage, leading to widespread protests. On December 8, 2021, a Dhaka court sentenced 20 BUET students to death and handed life imprisonment to five others for their involvement in the murder.

Anthony Albanese is going to become the Australian prime minister again. He is the first prime minister to win a second consecutive three-year term in 21 years. Opposition leader Peter Dutton conceded defeat in Saturday's election, saying, “We didn't do well enough during this campaign, that much is obvious tonight, and I accept full responsibility for that.” Official vote counting won't conclude for days, but Albanese's centre-left government is set to dramatically increase its majority after the Liberal-National coalition suffered a thumping defeat nationwide. Coalition leader Peter Dutton – who lost his own seat of 24 years – said he accepted full responsibility for his party's loss and apologised to his MPs. Labor has seen swings towards them in almost every area across the country – a rare feat for a second-term government in Australia - and Albanese becomes the first prime minister to win back-to-back elections in over 20 years. The party's success has also tempered a trend of voters abandoning the two major parties, which was the big story of the last election in 2022. Labor is on track to finish with 86 seats, the Coalition with 39, and the Greens Party with one or two, according to projections by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). Other minor parties and independent are ahead in 10 seats.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/112091,Pakistan reacted responsibly: Shehbaz,2025-05-03,"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has said that Pakistan’s reaction has been responsible and measured so far despite India’s provocative actions. On Saturday, the premier reiterated that Pakistan had always condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Shehbaz expressed his gratitude to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for his strong statement that supported Pakistan during the prevailing situation in South Asia as well as his call for peace in the region. The prime minister emphasised that India had failed to share any evidence and was falsely trying to link Pakistan to the Pahalgam incident, the statement said. The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe. Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to the military. As Pakistan, in the early hours of Wednesday, said it expected an Indian incursion within 24–36 hours, diplomatic channels have been engaged to prevent conflict. The prime minister also highlighted that Pakistan had rendered great sacrifices in its counter-terrorism efforts, including 90,000 casualties and over $152 billion in economic losses over the years. He further said that India’s actions would distract Pakistan from its counter-terrorism efforts.

The Sudanese Foreign Ministry confirmed the information on Saturday (May 3). A ministry statement said the attacks occurred over the past two days and accused the RSF of committing “crimes against humanity,” with the killings “carried out on an ethnic basis.” The ministry also reiterated its call for the United Nations Security Council and other international actors to end what it called “leniency” toward the RSF’s actions. Preliminary Committee of the Sudanese Doctors Syndicate, an independent humanitarian group, also confirmed the death toll of over 300, including 15 women and 21 children. The RSF has not yet commented on the allegations. On Friday, the RSF announced it had taken control of Al-Nuhood, seizing the headquarters of the Sudanese army’s 18th Infantry Division in the city after clashes between the two sides. The ongoing conflict between the army and the RSF, which started in mid-April 2023, has killed tens of thousands, displaced over 15 million people, and left Sudan facing one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, according to the United Nations. The country’s healthcare system has collapsed, and UN agencies warn that Sudan is on the brink of famine. Accurate casualty figures are difficult to verify, with war monitors estimating the death toll between 30,000 and 150,000.

The revolution it represents isn’t a moment in time—it’s a frontline that must be defended every single day,” he said. “The forces that opposed July haven’t disappeared. They are watching. Waiting. Preparing to pounce,” the press secretary said in a statement posted on his verified Facebook account on Saturday (May 3) night. He said it is now a battle between two visions of Bangladesh. One aspires to a democratic, free, and progressive nation, while the other is a kleptocratic, dynastic, Chetonazi regime clinging to the ghosts of its corrupt past, Alam said. “And make no mistake: the moment you relax, the moment you think the fight is over, they reappear—with violence, with propaganda, with venom,” he added. The press secretary said the anti-July forces have their “Laspensers”—those loyal scribes and spin doctors—eager to rewrite history and undermine July’s achievements. “They wait for the streets to empty so they can reclaim them. But I’ve learned: we must never leave the streets. Not just the physical streets, but the ideological ones too,” he said. NativeClick Ads Alam said the greatest challenge in any post-revolutionary moment is to defend the truth. “Because if you don’t, your opponents will gladly replace it with their fiction. Just look at the fate of the Biharis. Yes, some were collaborators during the Liberation War. But the vast majority were caught in the crossfire—massacred, marginalised, and silenced,” he said. He also said generations born in the Geneva camps now grow up in shame, denied the right even to tell their own stories. “That cannot be our fate.” “Wherever life takes me from here, one thing is certain: I won’t leave the streets. I won’t stop speaking about the massacres of July. “I won’t stop telling the truth about the long, dark years between 2009 and August 2024—a time of digital slavery, repression, and fear,” the press secretary said. He said the fight for a New Bangladesh is not just political but it is personal too. “It’s existential. It will shape the rest of my life.

The work on this road is progressing at a rapid speed. Those involved in the project say that the entire work will be completed by the end of 2026. Once the work is completed, the door of dreams will open. The long-standing traffic jams and endless suffering will come to an end. To complete the construction work on time, work of installing desk slabs on the double-decker road is currently underway. Most of the infrastructure of the double-decker road is becoming visible due to the relentless efforts of those involved in the project. According to experts involved in the project, the Panchabati-Muktarpur road modernization work has gained special momentum. To complete this 1.10 km long project worth Tk 2,242.77 crore before June next year, the widening of the old road and construction of a new double-decker road are going on simultaneously. Piles are sitting one after the other on the banks of the Dhaleswari and Buriganga. According to sources, the Panchabati-Muktarpur road has been modernized from the Panchabati intersection to six lanes for 310 meters on both sides of Fatulla and Narayanganj for easy communication with the capital city of Munshiganj district. And from Kashipur to Shitalakshya-3 bridge is on two-storied two lanes. The old road is widened with two more lanes up to Shitalakshya-3 point in Char Sayedpur. The 3.75 km road from the roundabout of the bridge to Muktarpur bridge is a four-lane road. After the project is 100 percent completed, new possibilities for communication will be opened on this road, avoiding traffic jams, said Moniruzzaman Monir, deputy assistant engineer of the project.

Russia has so far rejected an unconditional 30-day ceasefire pushed by Kyiv and Washington, which is trying to broker an end to the three-year Russian invasion of Ukraine. “This is more of a theatrical performance on his part. Because in two or three days, it is impossible to develop a plan for the next steps to end the war,” Zelensky said. Zelensky was speaking on Friday to a small group of journalists, in remarks embargoed until Saturday. Zelensky said Ukraine would not be “playing games to create a pleasant atmosphere to allow for Putin’s exit from isolation on 9 May,” when some foreign leaders are due in Moscow for Russian World War II commemorations. Russia’s proposal has been seen in Ukraine as an attempt to prevent Kyiv from hitting Moscow on the holiday, during which there is a grand military parade on Red Square and the Russian leader addresses the nation. Russia on Saturday accused Zelensky of threatening the security of its May 9 commemorations after the Ukrainian president said Kyiv would not “take responsibility” for ensuring safety on the day. “He is threatening the physical safety of veterans who will come to parades and celebrations on the holy day,” Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Telegram.

Trump said he was authorising the US Department of Commerce and Trade Representative to start the process to impose the levy because America’s movie industry was dying “a very fast death”. He blamed a “concerted effort” by other countries that offer incentives to attract filmmakers and studios, which he described as a “National Security threat”. “It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!"" Trump said on his Truth Social platform. “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!” US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick responded to the latest announcement, saying “We’re on it”. But the details of the move are unclear. Trump’s statement did not say whether the tariff would apply to American production companies producing films abroad. Several recent major movies produced by US studios were shot outside America, including Deadpool & Wolverine, Wicked and Gladiator II. Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed tariffs on countries around the world. NativeClick Ads He argues tariffs will boost US manufacturers and protect jobs - but the global economy has been thrown into chaos as a result, and prices on goods around the world are expected to rise.

The plan has already received an in-principle approval. Once sanctioned, it will be a shot in the arm for the force that has heightened vigil in the east following last year’s fall of the Sheikh Hasina government in Bangladesh and in the wake of a renewed challenge on the Pakistan front after the April 22 Pahalgam massacre. The BSF is soon expected to get the final sanction for raising 16 new battalions which will be raised over the next few years, sources in the security establishment told PTI. Some final approvals including sanction from the Union finance ministry are pending and are expected to be granted soon, they said. The paramilitary force has 193 battalions as of now to guard the two fronts. A battalion of the border force consists of over 1,000 troopers. Hence, the overall strength of the 16 new battalions will be around 17,000 personnel. These new battalions will help the BSF in its primary task of guarding the Pakistan and Bangladesh borders as per a blueprint being prepared by the border force, they said. The sources said two field command bases for the force have also been approved by the Union home ministry. One sector will come up in Jammu to strengthen security along the India-Pakistan International Border in Jammu and Punjab and the second will be based in Mizoram for better surveillance of the Bangladesh border, they said. NativeClick Ads The current sectors, headed by deputy inspector general (DIG) rank officers, in its Jammu frontier are located at Rajouri, Sunderbani, Jammu and Indreshwar Nagar. Under its Mizoram and Cachar frontier headquartered in Assam, the sectors are located at Silchar, Aizawl and one in Manipur. Sources said the BSF will initiate recruitment drives to hire men and women for these new battalions, followed by their training. The force is expected to raise these units over a period of five to six years, they added. According to officials, the 2.70 lakh personnel strong force had sent a proposal to the home ministry a few years ago to raise 20-21 new battalions owing to “the fast-changing security dynamics, profile of the terrain and related issues” in its primary task area of guarding the two borders apart from combat duties in the anti-Naxal operations theatre. The government finally agreed to raise 16 new battalions, they said. The BSF guards a total of 6,726 km of the two borders which includes 2,290 km of the India-Pakistan International Border and 339 km along the Line of Control (LoC) apart from 4,097 km of the front with Bangladesh. A total of around 1,047 km of these two borders is unfenced owing to those lines passing through riverine areas and harsh jungle terrain. The force has 1,760 border posts along these two frontiers.

""Rebuild and open Alcatraz! For too long, America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat criminal offenders, the dregs of society, who will never contribute anything other than misery and suffering. When we were a more serious nation, in times past, we did not hesitate to lock up the most dangerous criminals, and keep them far away from anyone they could harm. That's the way it's supposed to be. No longer will we tolerate these serial offenders who spread filth, bloodshed, and mayhem on our streets. That is why, today, I am directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt Alcatraz, to house America's most ruthless and violent offenders,"" the US leader wrote on his Truth Social page. ""We will no longer be held hostage to criminals, thugs, and judges that are afraid to do their job and allow us to remove criminals, who came into our country illegally. The reopening of Alcatraz will serve as a symbol of law, order, and justice,"" the president added. The prison is located on the island of the same name in San Francisco Bay.

The DMP requested the public to avoid the road from Gulshan-Banani to Uttara as much as possible and use alternative routes from morning to noon on Tuesday (May 6). The authorities allowed motorcycles and CNG-powered auto-rickshaws to ply on the Dhaka Elevated Expressway on that day to reduce public inconvenience. DMP requested all commuters to avoid the Airport Road from Gulshan/Banani to Uttara between morning and noon, and to use the following alternative routes: * Travel via Abdullahpur–Kamarpara–Dhour Bridge–Panchabati–Mirpur embankment to reach Gabtoli. * Use the Dhaka Elevated Expressway. * Residents of Uttara and Mirpur are advised to avoid Airport Road and instead travel via House Building–Zamzam Tower–Sector 12 canal area–Uttara North Metro Station–Uttara Centre Station–Mirpur DOHS, or take the Panchabati–Sector 18–Mirpur embankment route. * Travellers from Gulshan, Badda and Pragati Sarani can use the Police Plaza–Amtoli–Mohakhali route via Gulshan-1, then take the ramp near the Mohakhali Bus Terminal to access the Elevated Expressway towards Airport/Uttara. NativeClick Ads * Northbound inter-district buses from Mohakhali Bus Terminal to Mymensingh or Tangail can use the Mirpur–Gabtoli route. * Vehicles heading towards Airport or 300 Feet Road via the expressway should use the Mohakhali or FDC ramps instead of the Banani/Kakoli ramps. * From 8:00am to 2:00pm, only light vehicles may pass through the Cantonment roads (Zia Colony, Jahangir Gate, Sainik Club, Staff Road). * Autorickshaws and motorcycles may use the left-side safe lane of the Elevated Expressway between 7am and 1pm, subject to toll payment and a maximum speed limit of 40kph. Traffic police will be deployed to prevent speeding and lane violations. * To reduce congestion, the DMP has coordinated with Bangladesh Railway to add a special shuttle train on the Kamalapur–Tongi route from morning to noon. All intercity trains will stop for two minutes at Tongi, Airport and Tejgaon stations to help ease passenger movement. * Hajj pilgrims and outbound passengers, as well as SSC examinees in the area, must leave home with sufficient time to reach their destinations. * Metro rail has been recommended as an alternative for residents of Mirpur and Uttara.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/112166,Press wing debunks The Hindu report on targeting journalists by govt,2025-05-06,"Chief Adviser's Press Wing on Tuesday (May 6) binned a recent report of Indian newspaper The Hindu claiming the Prof Yunus-led Bangladesh government has targeted 640 journalists in eight months. A recent report of Indian newspaper The Hindu published on the World Press Freedom Day claiming the Prof Yunus-led Bangladesh government has targeted 640 journalists in eight months is fake, it said in a Facebook post on its verified account - CA Press Wing Facts. ""Allegations by the Rights and Risks Analysis Group (RRAG) published in The Hindu, that Bangladesh's Interim Government has targeted 640 journalists, are a wildly misleading piece of disinformation,"" it said. Since the Bangladeshis overthrew the brutal and corrupt regime of Sheikh Hasina's Awami League, many journalists perceived to have been linked to the regime have come under pressure from various quarters. Many have faced legal charges made possible by the flaws in the justice system deliberately created by the Awami League and now being corrected under the interim government, according to the statement. ""It is entirely untrue that the interim government itself has targeted journalists. On the contrary, the Chief Adviser, a Nobel Peace Laureate, and his Press Secretary, formerly an AFP bureau chief in Dhaka, among many others in the interim government, have been recognised for decades as champions of press freedom,"" it said. The press wing claimed that the RRAG, led by Suhas Chakma, on the contrary, is known to support the Awami League and has frequently spread disinformation about Bangladesh since Hasina's overthrow by the people of Bangladesh on August 5 last. RRAG played a central role in spreading inflated claims about the September 2024 violence in Bangladesh's Chittagong Hill Tracts. NativeClick Ads While credible Bangladeshi media confirmed four deaths in three incidents across Khagrachari and Rangamati, RRAG claimed nine indigenous people were killed - a figure unsupported by independent investigations.

Merz, 69, who led his conservatives to a federal election victory in February and has signed a coalition deal with the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), won 325 votes, nine more than needed for an absolute majority, in the secret ballot. He had secured just 310 votes in the first round of voting, meaning at least 18 coalition lawmakers failed to back him. After the vote, he headed to the nearby Bellevue Palace to be formally nominated by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Later, he will return to the historic Reichstag building in the heart of Berlin to take the oath of office to become Germany's 10th chancellor since the end of World War Two.

Speaking in response to the Operation Sindoor, Jaishankar stated that the global community must “show zero tolerance for terrorism,” emphasising India’s firm position as the armed forces executed precision strikes on nine identified targets early Wednesday. In the early hours of Wednesday, India carried out a military operation targeting nine terrorist training camps located in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir (PoJK). These camps were associated with three terrorist organisations: Lashkar-e-Taiba (Let), Jaish-e-Mohammed (Jem), and Hizbul Mujahideen. The operation involved the combined efforts of the Indian Army, Navy, and Air Force. The Indian government announced the strikes at 2 AM, describing them as ""focused, measured, and non-escalatory,"" suggesting they were precise, limited in scope, and intended to avoid further conflict escalation. According to officials, the operation was coordinated across branches and monitored closely by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who received real-time updates from the military top brass. In a statement, the Ministry of Defence described the strikes as “focused, measured, and non-escalatory,” clarifying that no Pakistani military installations were targeted. The objective was to deliver a calibrated message without provoking wider conflict. Meanwhile, Pakistan’s military and political leadership responded sharply, labelling the operation an “act of war.” Its foreign ministry accused India of violating its sovereignty and issued a warning of potential retaliation.

He also reaffirmed India’s commitment to eliminating terrorism from its roots. In a military operation following the Pahalgam terror attack, India launched ‘Operation Sindoor’, striking nine terror targets inside Pakistani territory. Taking to X, HM Shah posted, “Proud of our armed forces. Operation Sindoor is Bharat’s response to the brutal killing of our innocent brothers in Pahalgam.” “The Modi government is resolved to give a befitting response to any attack on India and its people. Bharat remains firmly committed to eradicating terrorism from its roots,” he added. The operation targeted infrastructure linked to terror groups responsible for the April 22 Pahalgam attack, which killed 25 Indian nationals and one Nepali citizen in Jammu and Kashmir. Sources cited by IANS, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi remained in constant communication with top military commanders and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval during the operation. According to official statements, the nine targets included camps and logistical bases associated with terror groups operating from within Pakistan and PoK. NativeClick Ads The Indian Army’s spokesperson emphasised the precise nature of the strikes, stating, “Our actions have been focused and precise. We have only targeted terrorist camps from where attacks against India have been planned and executed.” The Army further clarified that the operation was non-escalatory in intent and execution, aiming strictly at dismantling terror infrastructure while sparing civilian, military, and economic structures in Pakistan. “Justice is served. Jai Hind,” the spokesperson added. Indian intelligence agencies had earlier traced the Pahalgam attack to Pakistan-based groups, with The Resistance Front — a Lashkar-e-Taiba proxy — claiming responsibility.

Operation Sindoor, the sources said, was more than a military response. “It was a statement of strategic resolve. Through 24 precisely coordinated missile strikes across nine terrorist-linked locations, India demonstrated that it would no longer tolerate cross-border terrorism, nor the complicity of state institutions that enable it,” a source said. The counterstrike left more than 60 terrorists injured across the nine target locations -- Muzaffarabad, Kotli, Bahawalpur, Rawalakot, Chakswari, Bhimber, Neelum Valley, Jhelum, and Chakwal. These locations, the sources said, were identified as hubs of terrorist activity. The precision missiles targeted camps affiliated with Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad. The sources said the counterattack has significantly degraded the operational capability of these terror groups. Pakistan has said at least 9 civilians died, 38 were injured and two are missing. The collateral damage, Indian government sources said, was “minimised through precision targeting”. No Pakistani military installations were hit, they stressed. Sources in the government said Indian intelligence had cited clear evidence of the Pakistan Army’s logistical support to terror groups. The strikes aimed to expose and dismantle this deep-rooted nexus between the military and cross-border terrorism, they said. Government sources said that while global powers had urged both sides to exercise restraint, India has received support for its right to self-defence.

Director General of Inter-Services Public Relations (DG ISPR) has strongly condemned India’s latest aggression, labelling it a “cowardly and disgraceful” attack on innocent civilians. According to DG ISPR, the Indian Army violated the ceasefire agreement along the Line of Control (LoC) during the night of the 6th and 7th, resulting in the martyrdom of 31 civilians and injuries to at least 57 others. He said that instead of fighting Pakistan’s army, Indian forces purposely attacked innocent men, women, and children. He called this a cowardly act and proof of India’s lack of morals. DG ISPR also asked if the young children who were killed were the “terrorists” India claimed to be targeting. Highlighting India’s hypocrisy, he revealed that the Indian military also targeted mosques and even desecrated copies of the Holy Quran during the assault. “Which religion or principle of humanity allows the bombing of places of worship?” he asked. In contrast, DG ISPR confirmed that Pakistan’s response was strictly focused on military targets. The Pakistan Air Force displayed exceptional professionalism by destroying Indian military positions and aircraft, including three Rafale Jets, one SU-30, and one MiG-29, without harming civilians. He also revealed that the attack occurred while international media delegations were touring locations that India falsely accused of harbouring militants. “India launched this strike out of fear that its propaganda would be exposed,” he said. At the time of the attack, 57 commercial aircraft, including those from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, China, and South Korea, were airborne in Pakistani airspace. India’s actions endangered thousands of passengers’ lives, violating international aviation safety norms.

Leaves of all police personnel have been cancelled and public gatherings restricted as local authorities gear up for any escalation from the Pakistan side. Rajasthan, which shares a 1,037-km border with Pakistan, is on high alert. The border has been completely sealed and Border Security Force personnel have been given shoot-on-sight orders if they spot any suspicious activity. Authorities in Rajasthan have also restricted movement near the border for those who don’t live there. The Indian Air Force is on high alert. Flight movement from Jodhpur, Kishangarh and Bikaner airports has been suspended till May 9 as fighter jets patrol the skies in the western sector. Missile defence systems are activated, it is learnt. Sukhoi-30 MKI jets are conducting air patrols from Ganganagar to the Rann of Kutch. Schools in Bikaner, Sri Ganganagar, Jaisalmer, and Barmer districts have been shut and ongoing exams have been postponed. Leaves of cops and Railways staff have been cancelled. Border villages are on high alert and evacuation plans are in place for emergency response. Anti-drone systems near the border have also been activated. For Jaisalmer and Jodhpur, orders for blackout from midnight to 4 am have been issued. Blackouts create problems for advanced high-speed aircraft, making it difficult for enemy pilots to strike. In Punjab, the leaves of all police personnel have been cancelled and public gatherings have been restricted. Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann has also cancelled all government programmes because of the tension on the border.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/112205,Pakistan claims downing 12 Indian drones overnight,2025-05-08,"Pakistani officials announced Thursday that the country’s air defense systems shot down a dozen Indian drones overnight, including one that struck a military site near Lahore, injuring soldiers and causing damage. It follows Indian missile strikes on Pakistani locations that killed 31 civilians a day earlier, including women and children, according to officials. Meanwhile, India evacuated thousands of people from villages near the two countries’ highly militarized frontier in the disputed region of Kashmir. Tensions between the two countries have spiked since April 22, when gunmen killed 26 people, mostly Indian Hindu tourists, in India-controlled Kashmir. India accused Pakistan of backing the gunmen who carried out the attack, something Islamabad has denied. Pakistan’s army spokesman, Lt. Gen. Ahmad Sharif, said an Indian drone wounded four soldiers and partially damaged a military target near Lahore overnight, while the country’s air defense system intercepted and shot down 12 Indian drones that entered Pakistani airspace at various locations. He gave no further details about the attack. He added that in southern Sindh province, one civilian was killed and another wounded when debris from downed drones fell in a populated area._Agencies",pakistan claim down 12 indian drone overnight,pakistani offici announc thursdai countri air defens system shoot dozen indian drone overnight includ on strike militari site near lahor injur soldier caus damag follow indian missil strike pakistani locat kill 31 civilian dai early includ woman child accord offici meanwhil india evacu thousand peopl villag near two countri highli militar frontier disput region kashmir tension two countri spike sinc april 22 gunman kill 26 peopl mostli indian hindu tourist indiacontrol kashmir india accus pakistan back gunman carri attack someth islamabad deni pakistan armi spokesman lt gen ahmad sharif say indian drone wind four soldier partial damag militari target near lahor overnight countri air defens system intercept shoot 12 indian drone enter pakistani airspac variou locat give detail attack ad southern sindh provinc on civilian kill anoth wind debri down drone fall popul areaag,pakistani offici announc thursdai countri air defens system shoot dozen indian drone overnight includ on strike militari site near lahor injur soldier caus damag follow indian missil strike pakistani locat kill 31 civilian dai early includ woman child accord offici meanwhil india evacu thousand peopl villag near two countri highli militar frontier disput region kashmir tension two countri spike sinc april 22 gunman kill 26 peopl mostli indian hindu tourist indiacontrol kashmir india accus pakistan back gunman carri attack someth islamabad deni pakistan armi spokesman lt gen ahmad sharif say indian drone wind four soldier partial damag militari target near lahor overnight countri air defens system intercept shoot 12 indian drone enter pakistani airspac variou locat give detail attack ad southern sindh provinc on civilian kill anoth wind debri down drone fall popul areaag,5,pakistan_india_attack_say,0.06748466257668712,0.12883435582822086,0.11042944785276074,0.03680981595092025,0.4110429447852761,0.05521472392638037,0.049079754601226995,0.0736196319018405,0.03067484662576687,0.03680981595092025

The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said this on Thursday. The Pakistan military termed the downing of five Indian fighter jets as a major victory — and it was seemingly acknowledged when Indian officials admitted that at least three of their aircraft had “crashed” within their territory. Harop drones are a long-range loitering munition – effectively a flying bomb guided by an operator – that is made by Israel Aerospace Industries, an Israeli aerospace manufacturer. Earlier, Pakistan Army spokesman Lt. Gen. Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said 12 Harop drones had been shot down across Pakistan overnight Wednesday into Thursday. A day earlier, Pakistan mourned the loss of 31 lives in overnight attacks by Indian forces on civilians, describing New Delhi’s actions as “terrorism” and accusing it of continuous ceasefire violations on the Line of Control (LoC). On Wednesday, as both countries continued to trade heavy artillery fire, authorities revealed the extent of the damage caused by Indian strikes at six locations — Ahmedpur East, Muridke, Sialkot and Shakkargarh in Punjab and Muzaffarabad and Kotli in Azad Kashmir.

Pakistan used Chinese-made aircraft to shoot down five Indian fighter jets- three French-made Rafales, a MiG-29 and an Su-30 fighter. “Our jet fighters were J-10Cs that shot down the three French Rafales and other jets,” Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said Wednesday. He added that by 4 a.m. on Wednesday, there was “an entire Chinese team at the Foreign Office along with their ambassador” being updated on what had taken place. India has not responded to Pakistan’s claims or confirmed any losses. CNN has not been able to verify these claims.

In a major escalation, Pakistan launched a coordinated attack targeting 15 Indian cities in Gujarat, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Jammu & Kashmir on the night of May 7 and 8. The assault involved the use of drones and missiles, aimed at Indian military installations across Northern and Western India. India's advanced Integrated Counter-UAS Grid and Air Defence systems successfully intercepted and neutralised the incoming threats. The cities included Awantipura, Srinagar, Jammu, Pathankot, Amritsar, Kapurthala, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Adampur, Bhatinda, Chandigarh, Nal, Phalodi, Uttarlai, and Bhuj. Debris from these aerial platforms is currently being recovered from multiple impact sites, providing concrete evidence of Pakistan's deliberate targeting of Indian cities. In light of Pakistan's attempt to strike across such a wide geographic spread, India's armed forces this morning conducted precision strikes on Pakistani air defence radars and systems. Meanwhile, Pakistan has intensified its unprovoked artillery and mortar shelling along the Line of Control, especially in Kupwara, Baramulla, Uri, Poonch, Mendhar, and Rajouri sectors in Jammu and Kashmir.

Vance has said that the conflict between India and Pakistan is “fundamentally none of our business,” though he and President Donald Trump are encouraging both the countries to de-escalate. “What we can do is try to encourage these folks to de-escalate a little bit, but we’re not going to get involved in the middle of war that’s fundamentally none of our business and has nothing to do with America’s ability to control it. You know, America can’t tell the Indians to lay down their arms. We can't tell the Pakistanis to lay down their arms. And so, we’re going to continue to pursue this thing through diplomatic channels,” Vance, who has been a proponent of US disengagement from international conflicts, said in an interview with Fox News. “Our hope and our expectation is that this is not going to spiral into a broader regional war or, God forbid, a nuclear conflict,” Vance added. “Right now, we don’t think that’s going to happen.” The remarks by Vance came as Pakistan made a failed attempt to attack military establishment in Jammu, Pathankot and several other cities. India’s air defence system intercepted and neutralised at least eight missiles launched by Islamabad. Earlier, US President Donald Trump said he wants India and Pakistan to “stop” what he described as “tit for tat” actions, saying if he can do anything to “help”, he will be there. “Oh it's so terrible. My position is I get along with both. I know both very well and I want to see them work it out. I want to see them stop and hopefully they can stop now.

Pakistan army carried out artillery and mortar shelling targeting forward villages along the Line Of Control in Jammu and Kashmir.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/112240,Uncertainty looms over Asia Cup,2025-05-09,"The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is reportedly considering scrapping the Asia Cup 2025 and India’s scheduled tour of Bangladesh to create a window for completing the suspended Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 season. The currently suspended Indian Premier League's 16 remaining games can be completed during a 10 to 12 days window in September as the Asia Cup is now uncertain due to the rising armed hostilities between India and Pakistan. It would be a miracle if Asia Cup, which is supposed to be hosted by India (at a supposedly neutral venue), goes ahead given the raging conflict which was triggered by the killing of 26 people in a terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam. The nearly non-existent sporting ties are unlikely to resume at any level till tensions ease. The Asia Cup was given a 19-day window in September where at least two Indo-Pak matches were to take place apart from the possibility of a final clash between the bitter rivals which would have assured the broadcasters of high advertising revenue. “It is extremely bad optics if cricket continues when there is a possibility of war with a rogue nation (Pakistan). Sports can continue when everything is normal. Plus it is very natural for foreign players and coaches to be wary and wanting to return home,” a senior BCCI official told PTI on condition of anonymity after the league was suspended indefinitely on Friday. Incidentally, the Asian Cricket Council is now headed by Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Mohsin Naqvi and the onus will be on him to deal with financial losses that the Asia Cup cancellation would cause. It is understood that the BCCI top brass' decision to suspend the league was well thought out call as only a handful of matches are left which can be completed in a 10-day window with possible double-headers.

The ISPR said the operation “Bunyanun Marsoos,” meaning concrete structure, has been initiated and that multiple targets are being engaged all across India, the ISPR statement said. The ISPR said that an air base in Udhampur in Indian-controlled Kashmir has been destroyed, adding that an airfield in Pathankot district of India’s Punjab province has also been targeted and destroyed. Meanwhile, attacks on various other places are in progress. Official sources said that the BrahMos missile storage facility in the Indian city of Beas had been reportedly destroyed in the initial strike. The development came after India launched air-to-surface missiles at three air bases in Pakistan, a spokesperson for the Pakistani army said in the wee hours of Saturday. Earlier this week, the director general of the ISPR said that at least 31 people were killed and 57 others injured in an Indian attack on Pakistani territory and subsequent exchanges of fire between Pakistani and Indian troops along the Line of Control, the de facto border between the two neighbors.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/112247,"Driving change thru’ private initiatives in agriculture, water access",2025-05-10,"The role of private enterprises in improving the quality of life at the grassroots level of the country is increasing. Along with sustainable development, private organizations are coming forward in various ways for social welfare. Experts say that most private organizations are not only fulfilling their social responsibilities but are also genuinely committed to the welfare of society, a development that is highly encouraging for the country. Due to a lack of knowledge about technology and modern farming methods, many farmers in Bangladesh remain underdeveloped. The farmers of the country are lagging behind due to lack of knowledge about technology and modern methods. Despite working hard, they have to face losses. This has an impact on the rural society. Negative impact brings poverty. Addressing this concern, one of the leading private banks in the country, Standard Chartered Bangladesh, has taken initiatives in the northern region. Last year, the bank began training for 11,000 farmers across six districts of northern Bangladesh in environmentally friendly modern agricultural practices. Arranged through a local organization, the training took place in Bogura, Joypurhat, Sirajganj, Natore, Pabna and Rajshahi. Farmers were introduced to various modern farming technologies through this program. It not only increased productivity but also helped improve their standard of living. Several private initiatives are complementing government efforts to tackle the crisis of access to safe drinking water. Notably, the telecommunications company Robi has launched an impressive initiative to ensure the availability of drinking water in transit areas. Water plants have been installed at major railway stations, including Kamalapur, Dhaka Airport, Chattogram, Sylhet, Khulna, Rajshahi, Mymensingh, Mohanganj, Feni and Cumilla. These installations allow passers-by to easily access safe drinking water. Robi implemented this initiative in collaboration with Bangladesh Railway and the non-governmental organization WaterAid. This has particularly benefited homeless children and marginalized groups, protecting them from waterborne diseases caused by consuming contaminated water. Private efforts are also being made to deliver safe water to rural communities. Under an initiative by BAT Bangladesh, 48 out of 126 water purification plants have been installed in Kushtia district alone. These plants have been set up in Kushtia Sadar, Mirpur, Daulatpur, Kumarkhali and Bheramara upazilas. As a result, thousands of farmers and their families are gaining access to clean water, protecting them from waterborne diseases and arsenic contamination. In addition to ensuring safe water, BAT Bangladesh has also launched extensive tree plantation campaigns with the participation of local farmers in Kushtia. As part of this initiative, notable afforestation efforts have been carried out around the Lalon Shah Bridge, Kushtia Bypass Road, Kushtia-Jashore Highway and the GK Canal areas. Across the region, the impact of these efforts is visibly significant. It is worth mentioning that the organization has distributed over 130 million tree saplings across the country since 1980. Beyond safe water and environmental conservation, private initiatives are also working to ensure that farmers have easy access to credit. Syngenta Bangladesh is actively working to provide farmers with loans under flexible and farmer-friendly terms and is undertaking various initiatives for agricultural development. Simultaneously, the Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture is striving to bring long-term structural changes in the country’s food and nutrition systems. Professor Dr. Atikul Islam from the Department of Economics at Rajshahi University said, ‘The initiatives taken by private organizations for grassroots agriculture and environmental protection are certainly commendable. It is essential that their efforts are backed by thorough and appropriate research, ensuring not only benefits for the grassroots people but also long-lasting solutions to their problems.’",drive

The National Command Authority (NCA) is the highest civilian and military body responsible for the command, control, and operational decisions regarding Pakistan’s nuclear weapons program and strategic assets. The NCA also sets policy for all strategic nuclear forces and strategic organisations. According to security sources, the operation—launched in the early hours of Saturday—has targeted multiple high-value Indian military installations. Confirmed strikes include the destruction of the BrahMos missile storage site in Beas, Udhampur Airbase, Pathankot airfield, and Adampur Airfield, which was reportedly used to launch missiles into Amritsar, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Security officials further reported that India’s brigade headquarters at G-Top and the supply depot in Uri have been destroyed. In addition, Pakistan has targeted and neutralised an Indian artillery position in Dehrangyari and a BrahMos storage site in Nagrota, with reports of heavy losses. Officials also confirmed that Pakistan launched its Al-Fatah missile during the operation, naming it in honour of innocent Pakistani children killed in earlier Indian strikes. “Pakistan has neither forgotten nor will ever forget the sacrifices of these children,” a security source stated.

In a press briefing held by the Ministry of External Affairs, IAF Wing Commander Vyomika Singh confirmed that Indian forces remain on high alert as Pakistan appears to be preparing for further military aggression. “Pakistani troops have been observed moving into forward areas, indicating their intent to further escalate the tensions,” Singh said. According to Indian officials, Pakistan launched high-speed missiles targeting Indian air bases in Punjab around 1:40 AM, and also attacked medical facilities and schools in Srinagar, Avantipora, and Udhampur. Singh revealed that multiple Indian air bases, including those in Udhampur, Bhuj, Pathankot, and Bathinda, were attacked using drones, loitering munitions, and fighter jets, leading to damage of personnel and equipment. “A befitting reply has been given to Pakistani actions,” Singh said, noting that India had successfully neutralised many threats and remains ready to counter further provocations. India responded with targeted retaliatory strikes on Pakistani military bases, underscoring its readiness to respond proportionately while maintaining a commitment to non-escalation, should Pakistan choose to de-escalate. “Indian armed forces reiterated their commitment to non-escalation, provided the Pakistan side reciprocates,” Singh added.

He said, “Our youth want business, want jobs. They want peace in educational institutions. They want a democratic country, where everyone can speak freely. We want to establish that democracy.” Fakhrul Islam said, one of the message of today's youth rally is- “Young people, wake up again, everyone must foil the conspiracy and establish their rights.” BNP secretary general said, “Ziaur Rahman fought for a democratic country, Khaleda Zia worked for democracy.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/112263,Stay vigilant so that fugitive evil forces cannot rise again: Tarique,2025-05-10,"Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Acting Chairman Tarique Rahman has called upon all to stay vigilant so that the ""fugitive evil forces against democracy"" should not be able to rise again. Tarique Rahman was virtually addressing an exchange of greetings program organised by BNP on the occasion of Buddha Purnima at the Chairperson’s office in Gulshan on Saturday. “If we continue the bloody uprising of the brave people in 1971, 1975, 1990 and most recently in 2024, the democracy-loving people of the country completely agree on two issues- one is that no one can turn Bangladesh into a subservient state in the future and two is that the fugitive evil forces against democracy should not be able to rise again,” he said. The program began with the recitation of the Tripitaka by M. Sri Indra Banshamsa Bhikkhu, Bhadanta Sudharma Bhikkhu, Bhadanta Samaitri Ratan Bhikkhu and Ananda Priya Shraman. At the beginning of his speech, the BNP acting chairman extended Buddha Purnima greetings to the followers of Buddhism. He said, “The people of the country and the government as well do not want the rehabilitation of the fallen, fugitive, defeated evil forces that founded the barbaric Ayna Ghar.” “BNP wants to see this government successful. However, one thing remains here. For this reason, BNP has repeatedly called upon this government to announce an action plan-roadmap so that the public has a clear idea about the government's activities. Because, if the public has a clear idea about the government's activities, there is no room for any doubts or confusion,"" he said. The BNP acting chairman called upon the media in Bangladesh to publish more images of the misrule and misdeeds of Awami Legue regime and the events of July-August uprising. NativeClick Ads Stating that democracy is the only good alternative in the world to establish a safe and humane state, Tarique Rahman said, “In a democratic world, those who are against democracy in the state and politics are identified as the evil forces of democracy.” “Those who have been taking away the democratic rights of the people in Bangladesh for the past decade or the party that has been carrying out fascist rule and exploitation have been identified as the evil forces by the democracy-loving people of the country,” he added. The BNP Acting Chairman said, “BNP wants to establish a democratic government in the country through direct voting by the citizens that will be accountable to the people.” However, he urged all to remain vigilant from wherever they are, so that no one can conspire to undermine political rights and voting rights of the people. Tarique Rahman requesting the media to publish investigative reports on the incidents of the houses and places of worship of minority religious groups in various places including Ramu in Cox’s Bazar, Nasirnagar in Brahminbaria, Rangpur, Gaibandha, Sunamganj and other places during the decade and a half of AL rule.

After sounds of explosions were heard in Indian-administered Kashmir, India’s Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said there had been “repeated violations of the understanding we arrived at”. A short while later, Pakistan’s foreign ministry said it remained “committed to faithful implementation of a ceasefire...notwithstanding the violations being committed by India in some areas”. The fighting between India and Pakistan over the last four days has been the worst military confrontation between the two rivals in decades. The use of drones, missiles and artillery started when India struck targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in response to a deadly militant attack in Pahalgam last month. Pakistan had denied any involvement. After four days of cross-border strikes, India and Pakistan said they had agreed on a full and immediate ceasefire. US President Donald Trump announced the news on his Truth Social Platform on Saturday morning. He said it had been brokered by the US. Pakistan’s Foreign Minister later confirmed the agreement had been reached by the two countries, adding that ""three dozen countries"" were involved in the diplomacy. NativeClick Ads But hours after the announcement, residents in the main Indian-administered Kashmiri cities of Srinagar and Jammu reported hearing the sounds of explosions and seeing flashes in the sky. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said: ""For the last few hours, there have been repeated violations of the understanding we arrived at earlier this evening. ""This is a breach of the understanding arrived at earlier today."" Misri said India's armed forces was ""giving an appropriate response"" and he concluded his briefing by ""calling upon Pakistan to address these violations"". In response, a spokesman for Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: ""Pakistan remains committed to faithful implementation of ceasefire between Pakistan and India, announced earlier today. ""Notwithstanding the violations being committed by India in some areas, our forces are handling the situation with responsibility and restraint. ""We believe that any issues in smooth implementation of the ceasefire should be addressed through communication at appropriate levels. ""The troops on ground should also exercise restraint."" Kashmir is claimed in full by India and Pakistan, but administered only in part by each since they were partitioned following independence from Britain in 1947. It has been a flashpoint between the two nuclear-armed nations and they have fought two wars over it. Confirming the ceasefire, India's external affairs minister S Jaishankar said the two nations had ""worked out an understanding on stoppage of firing and military action"". ""India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It will continue to do so,"" he added. Later, in an address to the nation, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the ceasefire had been reached ""for the benefit of everybody"". Speaking after the ceasefire announcement, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said India and Pakistan had agreed to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site. He said he and US Vice-President JD Vance had spent 48 hours with senior Indian and Pakistani officials, including their respective Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Shehbaz Sharif. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he welcomed ""all efforts to de-escalate the conflict"". UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Britain has been ""engaged"" in talks for ""some days"", with Foreign Secretary David Lammy speaking to both sides. ""I'm pleased to see today that there's a ceasefire,"" Sir Keir said. ""The task now is to make sure that that is enduring and is lasting."" The recent fighting came after two weeks of tension following the killing of 26 tourists in the resort town of Pahalgam. Survivors of the 22 April attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, which killed 25 Indians and one Nepali national, said the militants were singling out Hindu men. The Indian defence ministry said its strikes this week were part of a ""commitment"" to hold ""accountable"" those responsible for the attack. Pakistan described them as ""unprovoked"". Pakistan said Indian air strikes and cross-border fire since Wednesday had killed 36 people in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, while India's army reported at least 21 civilians deaths from Pakistani shelling.

The prison houses nearly 5,000 inmates, it added.

The attack followed a similar drone strike on Friday, marking the seventh day of such assaults, which were also repelled by Sudanese army air defenses.

In a rare televised late-night address from the Kremlin, Putin said Russia was seeking “serious negotiations” aimed at “moving towards a lasting, strong peace”. Earlier on Saturday, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer travelled to Kyiv with counterparts from France, Germany and Poland to put pressure on Russia to commit to an unconditional ceasefire, starting Monday. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov later said Moscow would “have to think this through” - but warned that “trying to pressure us is quite useless”. In his own statement, Putin said he could “not rule out” the possibility that the talks could result in Russia and Ukraine agreeing “a new truce”. But he did not address calls for a 30-day ceasefire directly. The Russian leader said the proposed talks should be held in the Turkish city of Istanbul, as they have been before, and that he would speak to Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday to discuss the details. Kyiv has not responded to the invitation. The Ukrainian capital played host on Saturday to Sir Keir, France’s Emmanuel Macron, Germany’s Friedrich Merz and Poland’s Donald Tusk, who form part of the “coalition of the willing” - a group of countries committed to supporting Ukraine.

Alam said this ban was necessary to protect national security and sovereignty, ensure the safety of July Movement activists, and safeguard plaintiffs and witnesses of the International Crimes Tribunal. “We have seen that entire political parties -- not just their activities -- have been banned even in western democracies for crimes against humanity and for acting against core national interests,” he said. Germany and Italy banned Nazi and fascist parties after the Second World War (WW2), the press secretary said, adding that in Spain and Belgium, some political parties were banned for secessionist activities. He mentioned that the UNHCHR report demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that AL, its leadership and partymen, and its affiliated organisations participated in heinous crimes against humanity. Moreover, he said, this party caused wholesale destruction of democracy and the electoral process in Bangladesh. Alam said the AL’s leaders and supporters looted the banks dry and siphoned off colossal amounts of funds abroad.

The party's Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said this in a statement on Sunday (May 11). ""We’re pleased that, although delayed, the interim government has decided last night (Saturday) to wind up the activities of the fascist party, Awami League and all its affiliated organizations, in order to expedite the trial of those linked to the fascist regime for crimes against humanity and to ensure a smooth judicial process,"" he said. “However, if this decision would have been taken earlier by accepting our demands, the government could have avoided the awkward and undesirable situation of acting it under pressure,” he added. He continued, ""We hope that the interim government will keep this matter in mind carefully in conducting future activities."" “We urge the interim government to aware the growing public anger caused by the continued neglect of the call for a clear and specific roadmap to restore democracy,” he added.The BNP Secretary General said, ""We consider the decision to try the fascist party, which has carried out enforced disappearances, murders, oppression and misrule against the people for a long time, through judicial process, to be right."" Referring to previous meetings with the Chief Adviser regarding the demand for the trial of the fascist regime and its allies, Mirza Fakhrul stated, “In the letter submitted to him (Professor Muhammad Yunus) on February 10, we called for bringing Awami League, as a political party, under judicial proceedings for genocide and crimes against humanity.” NativeClick Ads He went on, saying “In our most recent meeting with the Chief Adviser on April 16, we reiterated our demand for the trial of the ousted fascist party, all individuals associated with its government, and for cleansing the country's political landscape of such elements.” It is worth noting that the BNP had opposed the previous government’s decision to ban Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, taken just before the fall of that fascist regime, on the grounds that their party rejects the banning of political parties through administrative orders, he mentioned. The BNP Secretary General said, “In the discussion, we made it clear that banning the fascist party Awami League through legal means is possible, and it should do. We have consistently raised these demands in various meetings, rallies, and discussions.” Reiterating the demand for the announcement of an election roadmap, Mirza Fakhrul said, “For 16 years, the people — deprived of their right to vote — have continued their struggle for the restoration of voting rights and democracy. Despite facing enforced disappearances, killings, imprisonment, and repression, they have resisted fascism. Yet, their demand remains unmet.”",happi decis stop al activ fakhrul,bangladesh nationalist parti happi governmentern decis stop organiz activ awami leagu parti secretari gener mirza fakhrul islam alamgir say statement sundai plea although delai interim governmentern decid last night wind activ fascist parti awami leagu affili organ order expedit trial link fascist regim crime human ensur smooth judici process say howev decis take early accept demand governmentern avoid awkward undesir situat act pressur ad continu hope interim governmentern will keep matter mind carefulli conduct futur activ urg interim governmentern awar grow public anger caus continu neglect call clear specif roadmap restor democraci addedth bnp secretari gener say consid decis try fascist parti carri enforc disappear murder oppress misrul peopl long time judici process right refer previou meet chief advis regard demand trial fascist regim alli mirza fakhrul state letter submit februari 10 call bring awami leagu polit parti judici proceed genocid crime human nativeclick ad go sai recent meet chief advis april 16 reiter demand trial oust fascist parti individu associ governmentern clean countri polit landscap element worth note bnp oppos previou governmentern decis ban bangladesh jamaateislami take just fall fascist regim grind parti reject ban polit parti administr order mention bnp secretari gener say discuss make clear ban fascist parti awami leagu legal mean possibl consist rais demand variou meet ralli discuss reiter demand announc elect roadmap mirza fakhrul say 16 year peopl depriv right vote continu struggl restor vote right democraci despit face enforc disappear kill imprison repress resist fascism yet demand remain unmet,bangladesh nationalist parti happi governmentern decis stop organiz activ awami leagu parti secretari gener mirza fakhrul islam alamgir say statement sundai plea although delai interim governmentern decid last night wind activ fascist parti awami leagu affili organ order expedit trial link fascist regim crime human ensur smooth judici process say howev decis take early accept demand governmentern avoid awkward undesir situat act pressur ad continu hope interim governmentern will keep matter mind carefulli conduct futur activ urg interim governmentern awar grow public anger caus continu neglect call clear specif roadmap restor democraci addedth bnp secretari gener say consid decis try fascist parti carri enforc disappear murder oppress misrul peopl long time judici process right refer previou meet chief advis regard demand trial fascist regim alli mirza fakhrul state letter submit februari 10 call bring awami leagu polit parti judici proceed genocid crime human nativeclick ad go sai recent meet chief advis april 16 reiter demand trial oust fascist parti individu associ governmentern clean countri polit landscap element worth note bnp oppos previou governmentern decis ban bangladesh jamaateislami take just fall fascist regim grind parti reject ban polit parti administr order mention bnp secretari gener say discuss make clear ban fascist parti awami leagu legal mean possibl consist rais demand variou meet ralli discuss reiter demand announc elect roadmap mirza fakhrul say 16 year peopl depriv right vote continu struggl restor vote right democraci despit face enforc disappear kill imprison repress resist fascism yet demand remain unmet,7,say_governmentern_parti_nation,0.07251908396946564,0.030534351145038167,0.04961832061068702,0.061068702290076333,0.04580152671755725,0.08015267175572519,0.45038167938931295,0.09923664122137404,0.0648854961832061,0.04580152671755725

The meeting was held at the State Guest House Jamuna Sunday, said a press release issued by the Chief Adviser’s Press Wing. According to the summary of the meeting, the Anti-Terrorism Act, 2009, was enacted to make provisions for the prevention of certain terrorist acts and ensure their effective punishment. To meet the purpose of the act, the government may, on the basis of reasonable grounds that any person or entity is involved in terrorist acts, list such person in the Schedule or declare the entity prohibited and list it in the Schedule by issuing official gazette notifications. However, there is no provision in the existing law regarding the prohibition of the activities of any entity.

He also said he is waiting for Russia to declare a ceasefire starting on Monday. “We await a full and lasting ceasefire, starting tomorrow, to provide the necessary basis for diplomacy. There is no point in prolonging the killings. And I will be waiting for Putin in Türkiye on Thursday. Personally. I hope that this time the Russians will not look for excuses,” he said. Last night, Russian President Vladimir Putin invited Kyiv to resume peace talks in Türkiye, which were interrupted in March 2022.

Welcoming Putin’s statement on resuming peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul, Erdogan said that Türkiye stands ready to host negotiations that will lead to a lasting solution. Before Zelenskyy announced that Ukraine agreed to resume talks with Russia in Istanbul, Trump wrote on Truth Social that Putin “doesn’t want to have a Cease Fire Agreement with Ukraine, but rather wants to meet on Thursday,"" in Türkiye “to negotiate a possible end to the BLOODBATH.

The decision comes ahead of President Donald Trump’s visit to the Middle East on Tuesday. Hamas said it was also intended to facilitate a deal for the entry of humanitarian aid. Gaza has been under an Israeli blockade for 70 days. Earlier a senior Hamas official said that the Palestinian armed group was holding direct negotiations with a US administration official in Qatar. The Israeli prime minister’s office said it had been informed by the US of the Hamas intention to release Alexander. A senior Palestinian official familiar with the negotiations said that Hamas’s announcement was intended as a goodwill gesture before Trump’s arrival. He said another meeting between Hamas and the mediators was scheduled for early Monday morning to finalise the process of Edan’s release, which would require a temporary halt to Israeli military activity and a suspension of aerial operations during the handover. President Trump confirmed Alexander’s release in a post on Truth Social, calling it “monumental news” and “a step taken in good faith”.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/112291,Pakistan never requested ceasefire: DG ISPR,2025-05-12,"Director General of Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Lt General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry clarified Pakistan’s position on the ceasefire and outlined the military's strategic handling of the escalation, firmly stating that Pakistan “never requested for a ceasefire.” “Let me put it on record: Pakistan never requested a ceasefire,” the DG ISPR said in a detailed briefing on Sunday. “On the night of May 6 and 7, after those dastardly and cowardly attacks were made, Indians requested [a ceasefire] and Pakistan gave a very clear response—that we will communicate back only after we have given the response that this act deserves,” he added. According to Lt Gen Chaudhry, it was only after Pakistan had executed its retaliatory campaign under ‘Operation Bunyan-un-Marsoos’ that Islamabad responded to Indian overtures. “So on May 10, after the response and retribution […] and on the request and intervention of international interlocutors, we responded to the already made request of the Indians.” He also addressed viral claims circulating on social media about an Indian pilot allegedly being captured by Pakistani forces. “I want to categorically state that Pakistan has no Indian pilot in custody,” he said, attributing the reports to “social media chatter” and disinformation campaigns. “This is all part of fake news and propaganda that has been generated from multiple sources.” Highlighting the high stakes of escalation between two nuclear-armed neighbours, DG ISPR called the idea of war between India and Pakistan “inconceivable” and “sheer stupidity.” “In a conflict between two rival nuclear powers … such a conflict is actually an absurdity,” he said, adding, “In the case of India and Pakistan, such a conflict can lead to peril of more than 1.6 billion people.” He added, “In reality, there is no space for war between India and Pakistan, and if anyone wants to carve out this space for war, he is actually carving out the space for mutual annihilation.” Despite provocations, Lt Gen Chaudhry stated that Pakistan had acted with strategic maturity throughout the conflict.

The deal, reached following intense weekend negotiations in Geneva, will see both countries significantly reduce duties on each other’s goods, with the US lowering its tariffs on Chinese products from 145% to 30% and China decreasing its own from 125% to 10% by May 14. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer made the joint statement public during a press briefing in Geneva. Though only temporary, the agreement is the most significant step toward easing trade tensions in years, providing a lifeline to global markets rattled by months of uncertainty. In the joint statement, both governments acknowledged the importance of “a sustainable, long-term, and mutually beneficial” trade relationship. To that end, the two sides will launch a new dialogue mechanism to maintain momentum, led by Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, Bessent, and Greer. Future talks may alternate between “China, the United States, or a third country upon agreement of the parties” venues, with lower-level technical discussions convened as needed.

His decision comes before this summer’s five-Test tour of England, which starts on 20 June, and follows captain Rohit Sharma’s retirement on Wednesday. Kohli, 36, has played 123 Tests for India and scored 9,230 runs at an average of 46.85. ""It's been 14 years since I first wore the baggy blue in Test cricket,"" Kohli posted on social media. ""Honestly, I never imagined the journey this format would take me on. It's tested me, shaped me, and taught me lessons I'll carry for life."" Kohli retired from T20 internationals in 2024, after India's World Cup victory, but is expected to continue playing one-day internationals. After making his Test debut against West Indies in 2011, Kohli went on to captain India in 68 of his Tests, with his 40 wins in charge making him the country's most successful leader in the format. ""There's something deeply personal about playing in whites. The quiet grind, the long days, the small moments that no-one sees but that stay with you forever,"" he added. NativeClick Ads ""As I step away from this format, it's not easy - but it feels right. I've given it everything I had, and it's given me back so much more than I could've hoped for. ""I'm walking away with a heart full of gratitude - for the game, for the people I shared the field with, and for every single person who made me feel seen along the way. I'll always look back at my Test career with a smile."" Kohli has long been regarded as one of the four batting greats of his era, alongside England's Joe Root, Australia's Steve Smith and New Zealand's Kane Williamson, and has scored 30 Test centuries. Only Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Sunil Gavaskar have scored more Test runs for India than Kohli, while he has the most centuries for an India captain with 20. But his most recent Test ton, 100 not out in the first Test against Australia in November, was his first in 15 innings across 16 months. During that series, he scored 190 runs in nine innings averaging just 23.75. Only three tons have come in 39 Tests since January 2020.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/112311,Ticket syndicate looted crores of taka from migrant workers,2025-05-12,"A high-level government investigation has unearthed a massive ticketing scam that defrauded Bangladeshi migrant workers of hundreds of crores of taka. The probe revealed that a powerful syndicate—comprising 11 international airlines, their General Sales Agents (GSAs), and at least 30 travel agencies—systematically manipulated the ticketing system, particularly on Middle East-bound routes. The nine-member investigation committee, formed by the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism, found that GSAs—especially those representing airlines of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, and Jajeera Air—established a monopoly over ticket distribution by Mr. Ahmed Yousuf Walid of Galaxy group who rule over at least 70% market share of Saudi Arabian points and middle east. By bypassing standard procedures, these GSAs facilitated preferential ticket allocation to select agencies, violating the permitted 7% commission cap and inflating ticket prices by 50% to 200%. The report further revealed that some travel agencies hoarded ‘block tickets’ and sold them through sub-agents at highly inflated rates. This artificial scarcity pushed ticket prices on the Dhaka–Saudi Arabia route to as high as Tk 1.9 lakh, even though the actual price should have been around Tk 50,000. The syndicate targeted Bangladeshi migrant workers—many of whom were forced to pay exorbitant prices to secure tickets for urgent overseas employment. The following agencies have been issued show-cause notices and summoned for formal hearings: Kazi Air International, Citicom International, King Air Aviation, RBC International, Mega International, Mother Love Air Travels, JS Travels & Tours, Sadia Travels, Hashem Air International, Naria Travels, Elham Corporation, and Al Ghazi Travels. Afsiya Jannat Saleh, General Secretary of the Association of Travel Agents of Bangladesh (ATAB), said, “Because of the GSA-controlled monopoly, legitimate travel agencies are denied access to tickets. Bribery and favoritism have become the norm. Unless strict action is taken, the syndicate will re-emerge.” ATAB’s complaints were among the key reasons the Civil Aviation Ministry intervened with emergency reforms. NativeClick Ads On February 11, the ministry issued a directive prohibiting ticket bookings without a passenger’s name and passport copy. As a result, many undisclosed block tickets were returned to the Global Distribution System (GDS), leading to greater transparency and a sharp drop in prices. Currently, ticket prices for the Dhaka–Saudi Arabia route have stabilized at around Tk 48,000 to Tk 50,000. Despite the exposure, critics argue that no visible punitive action has been taken against the syndicate’s masterminds. “Investigation and show-cause notices alone will not suffice,” said one stakeholder. “Without exemplary punishment, such practices will recur.”",ticket syndic loot crore taka migrant worker,highlevel governmentern investig unearth massiv ticket scam defraud bangladeshi migrant worker hundr crore taka probe reveal power syndic compris 11 intern airlin gener sale agent less 30 travel agenc systemat manipul ticket system particularli middl eastbound rout ninememb investig committe form ministri civil aviat tourism find gsa especi repres airlin saudi arabia qatar oman jajeera air establish monopoli ticket distribut mr ahm yousuf walid galaxi group rule less 70 market share saudi arabian point middl east bypass standard procedur gsa facilit preferenti ticket alloc select agenc violat permit 7 commiss cap inflat ticket price 50 200 report reveal travel agenc hoard block ticket sell subag highli inflat rate artifici scarciti push ticket price dhaka saudi arabia rout high tk 19 lakh even though actual price around tk 50000 syndic target bangladeshi migrant worker mani forc pai exorbit price secur ticket urgent oversea employ follow agenc issu showcaus notic summon formal hear kazi air intern citicom intern king air aviat rbc intern mega intern mother love air travel j travel tour sadia travel hashem air intern naria travel elham corpor al ghazi travel afsiya jannat saleh gener secretari associ travel agent bangladesh say gsacontrol monopoli legitim travel agenc deni access ticket briberi favorit becom norm unless strict action take syndic will reemerg atab complaint among kei reason civil aviat ministri interven emerg reform nativeclick ad februari 11 ministri issu direct prohibit ticket book without passeng name passport copi result mani undisclos block ticket return global distribut system lead great transpar sharp drop price current ticket price dhaka saudi arabia rout stabil around tk 48000 tk 50000 despit exposur critic argu visibl punit action take syndic mastermind investig showcaus notic alon will suffic say on stakehold without exemplari punish practice will recur,highlevel governmentern investig unearth massiv ticket scam defraud bangladeshi migrant worker hundr crore taka probe reveal power syndic compris 11 intern airlin gener sale agent less 30 travel agenc systemat manipul ticket system particularli middl eastbound rout ninememb investig committe form ministri civil aviat tourism find gsa especi repres airlin saudi arabia qatar oman jajeera air establish monopoli ticket distribut mr ahm yousuf walid galaxi group rule less 70 market share saudi arabian point middl east bypass standard procedur gsa facilit preferenti ticket alloc select agenc violat permit 7 commiss cap inflat ticket price 50 200 report reveal travel agenc hoard block ticket sell subag highli inflat rate artifici scarciti push ticket price dhaka saudi arabia rout high tk 19 lakh even though actual price around tk 50000 syndic target bangladeshi migrant worker mani forc pai exorbit price secur ticket urgent oversea employ follow agenc issu showcaus notic summon formal hear kazi air intern citicom intern king air aviat rbc intern mega intern mother love air travel j travel tour sadia travel hashem air intern naria travel elham corpor al ghazi travel afsiya jannat saleh gener secretari associ travel agent bangladesh say gsacontrol monopoli legitim travel agenc deni access ticket briberi favorit becom norm unless strict action take syndic will reemerg atab complaint among kei reason civil aviat ministri interven emerg reform nativeclick ad februari 11 ministri issu direct prohibit ticket book without passeng name passport copi result mani undisclos block ticket return global distribut system lead great transpar sharp drop price current ticket price dhaka saudi arabia rout stabil around tk 48000 tk 50000 despit exposur critic argu visibl punit action take syndic mastermind investig showcaus notic alon will suffic say on stakehold without exemplari punish practice will recur,10,bangladesh_will_bank_also,0.039301310043668124,0.043668122270742356,0.06550218340611354,0.048034934497816595,0.09606986899563319,0.06986899563318777,0.048034934497816595,0.07423580786026202,0.08733624454148471,0.4279475982532751

Security officials described the Indian claims as a “bundle of lies,” consistent with what they characterised as India’s long-standing pattern of misinformation. Asserting that the real violations were being committed by India, the sources noted that “Pakistan has been fully adhering to the ceasefire agreement.” “In reality, it is Indian drones that have been breaching the ceasefire along the Line of Control and Working Boundary,” they added. After the intervention of US President Donald Trump, Pakistan and India agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire on Saturday following days of intense military exchanges that raised fears of a full-scale conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/112323,‘This is first where political party`s registration cancelled through HC verdict’,2025-05-13,"Chief Justice Syed Refaat Ahmed has said that this is the first in Bangladesh’s history where a political party’s registration was cancelled through a High Court verdict. The Chief Justice made the observation on Tuesday during the hearing of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court on the appeal seeking restoration of Jamaat-e-Islami's registration. During the hearing, senior lawyer Ehsan Abdullah Siddiq represented Jamaat along with lawyers Shishir Monir. Lawyer Tawhidul Islam represented the Election Commission (EC). The hearing on Jamaat’s appeal originally began on 12 March this year but has since been deferred multiple times. On 7 May this year, the Appellate Division fixed 13 May to resume the appeal hearing on Jamaat's petition for reinstatement of its registration and electoral symbol. On 1 August 2013, the High Court declared Jamaat's registration as a political party illegal and void, following the disposal of a writ petition. Subsequently, on 7 December 2018, the EC formally cancelled the party's registration through a gazette notification. Jamaat later appealed the High Court verdict. However, in November 2023, the Appellate Division, led by then Chief Justice Obaidul Hassan, dismissed Jamaat's appeal for default as the party's principal lawyer failed to appear for the hearing. As a result, the High Court's verdict declaring Jamaat's registration illegal remained in effect. On 22 October last year, the Appellate Division revived a previously dismissed appeal by Jamaat, seeking to regain its registration as a political party.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/112329,Budget will not be implemented through borrowings: Finance Adviser,2025-05-13,"Finance Adviser Dr Salehuddin Ahmed has said that practical-based Annual Development Programme (ADP) will be undertaken in the new budget for FY26 while the budget will not be implemented through hefty borrowings from banks and printing money. The Finance Adviser was responding to the queries of reporters after chairing a meeting of the Advisers Council Committee on Government Purchase held at Bangladesh Secretariat on Tuesday. “There may be some deficit. But, to minimize that we’re negotiating with the World Bank and IMF regarding support and that is more or less successful”, he said. When asked about the promulgation of ordinance last night abolishing the National Board of Revenue (NBR) and thus creating two separate entities, he said that there would be no impact of this on revenue collection. “So far the revenue collection witnessed 2% growth compared to the last year and the scenario is not disappointing. I’m expecting more while the revenue collection won’t be less than the previous year,” he added. Replying to another question on the latest ordinance, the Finance Adviser suggested all for properly going through the ordinance adding that the new policy division would be a small division while there is nothing to worry about the revenue authority. He said it is international practice that the policy division and the implementation division would not remain the same as policy division is being run globally through professionals and experts like they have to have sound knowledge on economics, statistics and GDP. Mentioning that the ordinance has been promulgated after a thorough process, the Finance Adviser said that the issue was earlier discussed with the NBR members. NativeClick Ads Earlier in last night, the NBR has been dissolved and replaced with two new divisions under the ministry of finance in a bid to modernise tax administration and boost revenue collection. The restructuring took place through an ordinance promulgated last night.

And the fearless response of our people must have made his blood boil,” Khan said, claiming the Indian prime minister is still seething and may stage “another false flag” like the 2019 Pulwama incident in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).

This marks the fifth instance of China unilaterally renaming places in the Indian state, following similar moves in 2017, 2021, 2023, and 2024. The latest list includes residential areas, mountains, rivers, and other geographical features, accompanied by detailed coordinates and maps in Chinese, Tibetan, and Pinyin characters. India has categorically dismissed China’s recent move to assign new names to several locations in Arunachal Pradesh, labeling the action as “vain and preposterous.” The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) reiterated that Arunachal Pradesh is an “integral and inalienable part of India,” and such “creative naming” will not alter this reality. A fresh row over contested areas has erupted between India and China, with two sides issuing diverging statements. India on Wednesday rejected what it called ""preposterous attempts"" by China to rename places in the northeastern Arunachal Pradesh state. “We have noticed that China has persisted with its vain and preposterous attempts to name places in the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Randhir Jaiswal said in a statement.

The entire program, for which the Nobel Prize was awarded, was initiated at this university. One, I personally received the Nobel Prize. Two, the Grameen Bank was launched on CU campus”. The Chief Adviser said this while delivering his speech at the 5th Convocation Ceremony of Chittagong University (CU) on the university's central playground on Wednesday. In his convocation speech, Prof Yunus said “We will be able to build the world the way we want to build”. But everyone has to have a dream about what kind of environment and society he or she wants to establish, he added. Recalling the background of the establishment of Grameen Bank, the Chief Adviser said the ongoing civilisation is a civilisation of destructive economy. “The economy we established is an economy of business, not of people,” he said, adding that the business-oriented civilisation is a suicidal one, which will not sustain.

The BJP leader made the comment while addressing a public meeting in Mhow, Indore district, on May 13, 2025. On Wednesday, the Madhya Pradesh High Court directed the registration of an FIR against Shah for his comment. The comments, which appeared to link Colonel Qureshi to “terrorists” while referencing her role in media briefings for Operation Sindoor, drew widespread condemnation from opposition leaders, activists, and the public. Following intense backlash and a summons from the state BJP leadership, Shah issued a public apology, claiming his remarks were misconstrued. Speaking at a government function in Manpur near Mhow, Shah praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership in response to the April 22, 2025, Pahalgam attack. However, his speech took a divisive turn when he alluded to Colonel Qureshi, who, along with Wing Commander Vyomika Singh and Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, briefed the media on Operation Sindoor, India’s military response to the attack.",bjp minist call col sofia qureshi isist terrorist,madhya pradesh tribal affair minist kunwar vijai shah senior bharatiya janata parti leader call indian armi offic colonel sofia qureshi isist terrorist bjp leader make comment address public meet mhow indor district mai 13 2025 wednesdai madhya pradesh high court direct registr fir shah comment comment appear link colonel qureshi terrorist referenc role medium brief oper sindoor draw widespread condemn opposit leader activist public follow intens backlash summon state bjp leadership shah issu public apologi claim remark misconstru speak governmentern function manpur near mhow shah prais prime minist narendra modi leadership respons april 22 2025 pahalgam attack howev speech take divis turn allud colonel qureshi along wing command vyomika singh foreign secretari vikram misri brief medium oper sindoor india militari respons attack,madhya pradesh tribal affair minist kunwar vijai shah senior bharatiya janata parti leader call indian armi offic colonel sofia qureshi isist terrorist bjp leader make comment address public meet mhow indor district mai 13 2025 wednesdai madhya pradesh high court direct registr fir shah comment comment appear link colonel qureshi terrorist referenc role medium brief oper sindoor draw widespread condemn opposit leader activist public follow intens backlash summon state bjp leadership shah issu public apologi claim remark misconstru speak governmentern function manpur near mhow shah prais prime minist narendra modi leadership respons april 22 2025 pahalgam attack howev speech take divis turn allud colonel qureshi along wing command vyomika singh foreign secretari vikram misri brief medium oper sindoor india militari respons attack,5,pakistan_india_attack_say,0.10218978102189781,0.06569343065693431,0.058394160583941604,0.043795620437956206,0.3357664233576642,0.0948905109489051,0.13138686131386862,0.0364963503649635,0.072992700729927,0.058394160583941604

Clashes broke out late on Monday after the killing of a major militia leader. After calming on Tuesday morning, the fighting reignited overnight, with major battles rocking districts across the entire city. ""Regular forces, in coordination with the relevant security authorities, have begun taking the necessary measures to ensure calm, including the deployment of neutral units,"" the defence ministry said. The ministry said the neutral units it was deploying around sensitive sites were from the police force, which does not carry heavy weapons. After the fighting, burned-out cars littered the streets in some areas, and nearby buildings were pocked with bullet marks. Monday's clashes had appeared to consolidate the power of Abdulhamid al-Dbeibah, prime minister of the divided country's Government of National Unity (GNU) and an ally of Turkey. However, any prolonged fighting within Tripoli risks drawing in factions from outside the capital, potentially leading to a wider escalation between Libya's many armed players after years of relative calm. The main fighting on Wednesday was between the Dbeibah-aligned 444 Brigade and the Special Deterrence Force (Rada), the last major armed Tripoli faction not currently in his camp, the English-language Libyan Observer reported._Agencies.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/112367,We have avenged 1971 war: Shehbaz Sharif,2025-05-15,"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has declared the success of Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos as a historic moment, saying the Pakistan armed forces had avenged the 1971 war by giving a decisive and powerful response to Indian aggression, Geo.tv reports. “History will eternally record, how within few hours, Pakistan’s defenders extinguished India’s unprovoked aggression with unmatched precision and resolve,” he said while addressing soldiers deployed at the frontline areas in Pasrur Cantonment near Sialkot. The prime minister accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal and Information Minister Attaullah Tarar. Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Syed Asim Munir and Chief of Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu were also present during the visit, the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) said. During the visit, the prime minister received a comprehensive briefing on the conduct of the battle and the current operational preparedness of the Corps. Addressing the personnel, he said the valiant Pakistan Armed Forces, fortified by the unwavering resolve of the nation, defended the motherland in a heroic manner and dealt a decisive blow to the adversary’s dastardly aggression. The premier said books would be written on Pakistan’s recent military success, calling it a testament to the bravery and professionalism of the armed forces. He commended the leadership and personnel of the army, navy and air force, saying they had “put the enemies of Pakistan in their place”. NativeClick Ads Taking aim at Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, PM Shehbaz said the world knows who trained Mukti Bahini in 1971. “Today, the same nexus is seen in support of groups like the BLA and TTP, and it leads back to Modi.” He rebuffed recent statements made by the Indian prime minister, saying: “Mr Modi, keep your fiery speeches to yourself. Pakistan seeks peace in the region, but do not mistake our desire for stability as weakness.” Referring to the suspension of Indus Waters Treaty, he warned India against tampering, saying: “If India even thinks of stopping Pakistan’s water, let it be known: water and blood cannot flow together,” he warned. “This is a red line we cannot compromise on.” He noted the armed forces had crushed the false sense of regional dominance harboured by India. “The illusion that India is the regional power has been shattered,” he added. The prime minister assured that Pakistan was committed to dialogue on all unresolved issues, including Kashmir dispute. However, he said: “We will not allow a one-sided approach where only sweet things are welcomed and the bitter truths ignored.” He also warned Modi that any future hostility from India would be met with a forceful and unprecedented response. “Modi, if you attempt another act of aggression, you will face consequences beyond imagination,” he added. Interacting with officers and brave men at the frontline, the premier lauded their high morale, exceptional professionalism, and unflinching readiness. “Pakistan takes immense pride in its brave sons they are the crown jewels of the nation,” he said, adding that the blatant aggression against innocent civilians resulting into martyrdom of children, women and elderly and calling them terrorists is utterly shameful and against all international laws, norms and morality. He stated that despite Pakistan’s offer of neutral investigations, India deliberately evaded such a path, as they had nothing to prove and based on a false pretext and bloated arrogance and ego, launched the offensive, “for which it has got a very befitting response”. The premier also said that the martyrs have always been ""our pride and the nation shall eternally remain indebted to them"". 'Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos' Pakistan armed forces launched a large-scale retaliatory military action, named ""Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos"" and targeted several Indian military strikes across multiple regions. The strikes, described by officials as ""precise and proportionate"", were carried out in response to India's continued aggression across the Line of Control (LoC) and within Pakistan's territory, which New Delhi claimed were aimed at ""terrorist targets"". After at least 87 hours, the war between the two nuclear-armed nations ended on May 10 with a ceasefire agreement brokered by the United States. According to ISPR, a total of 53 individuals, including 13 personnel of the armed forces and 40 civilians, were martyred in Indian strikes during the recent military confrontation. The military confrontation between the two countries was triggered by last month’s attack in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) that left 26 tourists dead, with India blaming Pakistan for the attack without offering any evidence. Islamabad denied any links to the attack and called for a neutral investigation.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/112368,"Gaza death toll tops 52,900",2025-05-15,"At least 52,928 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s genocidal war on the Gaza Strip since October 2023, Anadolu Ajansı reported quoting the Health Ministry on Wednesday (May 14). A ministry statement said that 20 people were killed in Israeli attacks in the last 24 hours, while 125 others were injured, taking the number of injuries to 119,846 in the Israeli onslaught. “Many victims are still trapped under the rubble and on the roads as rescuers are unable to reach them,” it added.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/112369,India may attempt another misadventure: Khawaja Asif,2025-05-15,"Defence Minister Khawaja Asif has warned of another possible Indian misadventure, saying Pakistan would respond forcefully if provoked. Speaking with Geo News on Wednesday, Asif said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was politically cornered and could take impulsive action due to mounting pressure and declining political capital. “If Modi makes a reckless move out of desperation, Pakistan will respond decisively – and there will be global consequences,” Asif said. The defence minister stated that in the event of further escalation, even India’s allies may refrain from backing Modi’s actions. “There was no external pressure on Pakistan to agree to a ceasefire,” he added. “The United States and other friendly countries were on board and supported the idea, which is why we agreed.” Asif said Pakistan exercised restraint for four days, hoping India would show reason. “Our victory is multidimensional. This was the first conflict in which cyber warfare played a key role. India’s digital infrastructure was paralysed during the cyber operations,” he said. He further stated that international perceptions of Pakistan have changed. “Those who did not take us seriously now look at us with respect,” he maintained, saying Pakistan downed five Indian aircraft and one UAV during the recent conflict with India. On Kashmir issue, the defence minister remarked that India had shown some willingness to engage. “For the first time, India seems ready to discuss the Kashmir issue – that in itself is a diplomatic success for Pakistan,” he said. NativeClick Ads Asif’s statement comes after a full and immediate ceasefire between India and Pakistan was announced on May 10, following days of heightened military exchanges that brought the two nuclear-armed neighbours to the brink of war. The announcement was first made by US President Donald Trump and later confirmed by Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. India-Pakistan ceasefire Tensions flared following an April 22 attack in Pahalgam, Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), which left 26 civilians dead. India blamed Pakistan-based elements without presenting any evidence, Islamabad rejected the allegations. In response, India closed the Wagah border, revoked visas, and suspended the Indus Waters Treaty—moves Pakistan called an “act of war.” The conflict intensified with India's missile attracks and drone incursions as it launched its Operation Sindoor. Pakistan's military launched Operation Bunyan-un-Marsoos in retaliation, and announced it had downed five Indian jets—including Rafales—and intercepted 77 Israeli-made Harop drones. Following diplomatic intervention led by Washington, both sides agreed to halt military activity across land, air, and sea.

science-technology,https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/112377,Prospect of expanding Afghanistan-Bangladesh trade,2025-05-15,"The interest of the small business groups in Bangladesh to increase engagement with Afghanistan has increased recently. Though Afghanistan has not been in the radar of leading businessmen and exporters, small business leaders see the prospect of 100 million US dollars with the South Asian country in the next couple of years. According to available sources, the trade between Bangladesh-Afghanistan is hovering at some 30 million US dollars. Bangladesh’s export to Afghanistan recorded at $8.8 million (8858124.13 US dollars during the July-March period of 2024-25, according to data of the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) Bangladesh ’s export to Afghanistan recorded at (10 million US dollars) 10164582.64 US dollars during the July-June period of 2023-24 fiscal year, according to data of the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB). Some 42 per cent of Afghanistan’s total exports go to Pakistan, 40 per cent to India, 4.00 per cent to China, 2.00 per cent to UAE and 2.00 per cent to Turkey, according to Afghanistan data of Afghanistan. Afghanistan, the landlocked country in South Asia, can offer the best quality of fruits to Bangladesh at the most competitive prices compared to countries like South Africa, Brazil, China, Australia, India, Pakistan and Egypt, sources said. Apples come from South Africa, Brazil, China, and Australia, pomegranates from India, pears from Pakistan, sweet oranges from Egypt, tangerines from China and India, and grapes from India, industry people say. Bangladesh roughly spent $450 million in 2021-22 fiscal year to procure fruits from the countries like India, Pakistan, Egypt, South Africa, Brazil, China and Australia, industry people say. NativeClick Ads Traders opened LCs worth $247.26 million in July-January of 2023-24 fiscal year, up 25.81 percent year-on-year, central bank data showed. The purchase from external sources was $196.54 million in the identical seven months of the previous financial year and $326.33 million in 2021-22. About 40 percent of the country's demand for fruits is met locally, while the rest comes from imports. Afghanistan exports dry food to Bangladesh through Karachi and Chittagong ports as the South Asian county is a land locked one. Afghanistan has the population of over 40 million and Bangladesh can penetrate in the Afghan clothing market, said a member of the Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA)). Sources said China has the largest penetration of clothing market in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, Afghanistan’s economy is projected to grow by 2.6 percent in 2025, according to the International Monetary Fund’s latest World Economic Outlook released this week. This forecast places Afghanistan near the bottom of regional growth expectations, reflecting both internal economic constraints and the broader global slowdown. The IMF’s global growth projection for 2025 stands at 2.8 percent, the lowest since 2020 and the second-weakest figure since the 2009 financial crisis. The report attributes this deceleration to heightened trade tensions, rising tariffs, and policy uncertainty, particularly involving major economies such as the United States and China. Within Central Asia, Afghanistan’s projected growth rate lags behind several neighboring countries. For instance, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are expected to grow by 6.8 percent and 6.7 percent, respectively, while Uzbekistan is forecasted at 5.9 percent. Even Turkmenistan, with a projected growth of 2.3 percent, is only slightly behind Afghanistan. The IMF anticipates a modest improvement in Afghanistan’s economic performance in 2026, projecting a growth rate of 3.4 percent. However, this remains below the regional average and underscores the challenges facing the country’s economy. Afghanistan’s economic outlook is constrained by several factors, including limited access to international financial systems, reduced foreign aid, and restrictions on women’s participation in the workforce. These issues are compounded by internal challenges such as high unemployment, food insecurity, and a fragile banking sector. The IMF’s report emphasizes the need for structural reforms to enhance economic resilience. Recommendations include improving domestic revenue mobilization, fostering private sector development, and ensuring inclusive policies that enable broader participation in the economy. According to Al Jazeera in 2021, the U.S. freeze nearly $9.5 billion in assets belonging to the Afghan central bank and stopped shipments of cash to the nation as it tries to keep a Taliban-led government from accessing the money, an administration official confirmed recently. The official said that any central bank assets that the Afghan government has in the U.S. will not be available to the Taliban, which remains on the Treasury Department’s sanctions designation list. Taliban officials denounced claims that the United States could regain custody of Afghanistan's frozen central bank funds, warning that any such action would be ""unacceptable."" The Taliban-led Ministry of Economy issued the warning in response to the latest quarterly report released to the U.S. Congress on Friday stating that the government in Kabul is not recognized by Washington and has been subjected to economic sanctions. In August 2021, when Taliban insurgents retook control of the country just days before the withdrawal of all American and NATO troops, then-President Joe Biden froze about $7 billion in assets that were held in the U.S. by the Afghan central bank. Additionally, European countries froze around $2 billion. Washington subsequently transferred half of the frozen funds, amounting to $3.5 billion, to a newly established ""Afghan Fund"" in Switzerland. That fund is intended to support humanitarian assistance in impoverished Afghanistan while ensuring that the Taliban cannot access the money, but no payments have since been released. The remaining $3.5 billion was retained in the U.S. to fund potential compensation for ongoing court cases against the Taliban, brought by families of the September 11, 2001, attack victims. In August 2021, the United States withdrew the last of its troops from Afghanistan, ending its military presence there after nearly 20 years. Inflation in Afghanistan turned negative because of currency appreciation and subdued demand. In FY2024, annual inflation dropped from 10.6% to –7.7%, with food prices declining by 11.8% and prices for other items falling by 3.0% (Figure 2.14.2). Deflation resulted as the Afghani strengthened, reducing import prices demand was subdued and supply chains suffered fewer disruptions. The appreciation of the Afghani against key currencies, including the Pakistan rupee, Iranian riyal, and US dollar, contributed to lower domestic prices, as imports play a dominant role in the economy (Figure 2.14.3). Monetary policy continued to have little effect on prices. The merchandise trade deficit widened to 36.6% of GDP, reflecting currency appreciation and lower demand for minerals (Figure 2.14.4). In FY2024, exports dropped by 3.5% to $1.8 billion, mainly from reduced demand for Afghan coal in Pakistan and stagnant agricultural exports affected by currency appreciation. Merchandise imports increased by 13.5% to $8.0 billion. This reflected a 112.5% rise in intermediate goods and a 36.8% rise in consumer goods, fueled by private consumption, with Pakistan and Iran remaining Afghanistan’s largest import suppliers. The overall trade deficit in goods and services remained substantial at 42.4% of GDP, with imports rising by 12.1% and exports remaining stable Meanwhile, Afghanistan has one of the world’s lowest electricity consumption rates per capita. The country can generate only 20% of its electricity domestically, and barely one-third of its 36 million citizens are connected to the power grid. The remainder of its electricity is imported from Uzbekistan (40.5%), Tajikistan (24.0%), Turkmenistan (20.5%), and Iran (15.0%). The Afghanistan Power Sector Master Plan 2011 forecast electricity demand to rise from 2,800 gigawatt-hours in 2012 to 15,909 in 2032, with an annual growth rate of 9.8%. Peak demand was expected to grow by 8.6% annually, from 600 megawatts (MW) in 2012 to 3,502 MW in 2032. Actual demand in FY2024 was 1,500 MW, largely on track with the forecast. South Asia is one of the least integrated regions in the world in terms of trade and people-to-people contact. At present, regional trade in South Asia accounts for only 5% of estimated $23 billion in trade flow well below the potential trade of $67 billion. While the ratio of trade in other regions are East Asia: 50%, ASEAN: 26%, EU: 67%, NAFTA: 62%, LAC and COMESA 22%. Referring to the World Bank estimates, ICC Bangladesh reports Intra-regional trade now stands at just one-fifth of trade potential among South Asian countries. Meanwhile, India and Afghanistan held the highest-level talks since the Afghan group’s takeover of Kabul in 2021 in Dubai in January, 2025. The Taliban's foreign office said they saw India as a ""significant regional and economic partner"" after meeting with its most senior foreign ministry official, the highest level talks with Delhi since their takeover of Afghanistan in 2021. Against this backdrop, Bangladesh should explore and increase economic engagement with Afghanistan as the economy of the South Asian county is expanding slowly. In South Asia, Afghanistan's national currency, the afghani, is one of the strongest currencies against the US dollar. Currently, one U.S. dollar is traded at 72.30 afghani, compared to 69 afghanio.",prospect expand afghanistanbangladesh trade,interest small busi group bangladesh increas engag afghanistan increas

U.S. President Donald Trump said this in Qatar on Thursday. “I have concepts for Gaza that I think are very good, make it a freedom zone, let the United States get involved and make it just a freedom zone,” he said. He also said that the United States was nearing a nuclear deal with Iran, and that Tehran had “sort of” agreed to the terms. Iran has held four rounds of discussions with the Trump administration, which is working to prevent a potential Israeli military strike on Tehran’s disputed nuclear programme. Trump also said that Iran should “say a big thank you” to Qatar’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, crediting him for urging the US not to take military action against Iran.

However, like in other countries, he believed that every newspaper should have guidelines for journalists on their own use of social media. He said accreditation cards will be issued soon for the genuine journalists through necessary verification and maintaining transparency. “The government will not allow any leader of any party to lobby for accreditation cards,” he said.

Referring last year's visit of Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim to Bangladesh, Dr Asif Nazrul said the Malaysian premier is a personal friend of Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus and during that visit he had given assurance that he would give a chance to around 17,000 Bangladeshi workers, who failed to go to Malaysia by the May 31, 2024 deadline. “We have had many discussions based on this. They said that they would take those laborers on batch-wise and they have prepared a list of 7,926 workers in the first batch. They would give them opportunity to go and work there within a very short time and they (Malaysian administration) have already started the process,"" he added. “We have learned from different sources that Malaysia is going to recruit one lakh to 1.5 lakh foreign workers within the next couple of months. I have had talks with their Human Resources Minister (Steven Sim Chee Keong) and he assured us that Bangladesh will be given the highest priority in recruiting laborers. Maximum number of laborers will be recruited from Bangladesh, we have received this assurance,” Dr Asif Nazrul, who is currently visiting Malaysia, said.",8000 worker final go malaysia asif nazrul,expatri welfar oversea employ advis dr asif nazrul say final list 7926 worker first batch will go malaysia soon advis say video post verifi facebook account thursdai advis say offici meet malaysian minist home affair human resourc minist inform discuss trade minist good develop share ad refer last year visit malaysian prime minist anwar ibrahim bangladesh dr asif nazrul say malaysian premier person friend chief advis professor muhammad yunu visit give assur give chanc around 17000 bangladeshi worker fail go malaysia mai 31 2024 deadlin mani discuss base say take labor batchwis prepar list 7926 worker first batch give opportun go work within short time alreadi start process ad learn differ sourc malaysia go recruit on lakh 15 lakh foreign worker within next coupl month talk human resourc minist assur u bangladesh will give high prioriti recruit labor maximum numb labor will recruit bangladesh receiv assur dr asif nazrul current visit malaysia say,expatri welfar oversea employ advis dr asif nazrul say final list 7926 worker first batch will go malaysia soon advis say video post verifi facebook account thursdai advis say offici meet malaysian minist home affair human resourc minist inform discuss trade minist good develop share ad refer last year visit malaysian prime minist anwar ibrahim bangladesh dr asif nazrul say malaysian premier person friend chief advis professor muhammad yunu visit give assur give chanc around 17000 bangladeshi worker fail go malaysia mai 31 2024 deadlin mani discuss base say take labor batchwis prepar list 7926 worker first batch give opportun go work within short time alreadi start process ad learn differ sourc malaysia go recruit on lakh 15 lakh foreign worker within next coupl month talk human resourc minist assur u bangladesh will give high prioriti recruit labor maximum numb labor will recruit bangladesh receiv assur dr asif nazrul current visit malaysia say,9,advis_chief_bangladesh_yunu,0.08771929824561403,0.04678362573099415,0.10526315789473684,0.11695906432748537,0.05263157894736842,0.03508771929824561,0.14035087719298245,0.05263157894736842,0.21637426900584794,0.14619883040935672

politics,https://www.risingbd.com/english/politics/news/111243,China to lift hukou-based marriage registration restrictions nationwide,2025-03-25,"China will soon offer nationwide access to its cross-regional marriage registration service, following a recent revision of the regulations governing marriage registration, the Ministry of Civil Affairs said on Saturday, reports people’s daily. Under the new rules, couples will no longer need to register marriages in the location of their hukou, which is permanent household registration. Instead, they will be able to choose a registry office in the habitual residence of either party, removing a significant logistical barrier. This reform is aimed at addressing the needs of people who live or work away from their registered hometowns, particularly younger generations. Previously, couples had to return to their hukou location for marriage registration, which created travel and financial difficulties. According to the latest national census, about 493 million Chinese people lived away from their hukou location in 2020, an 88.52 percent increase from a decade earlier. A pilot program for inter-provincial marriage registration began in June 2021 and was gradually expanded to 21 provincial-level regions, including Beijing, Shanghai and Inner Mongolia.

This is as the country’s disaster agency assessed if there were any tsunami threats. The National Emergency Management Agency advised residents of the Southland and Fiordland regions to stay away from beaches and marine areas as strong and unusual currents may present a danger. Government seismic monitor Geonet said at least 4,700 people felt the quake, as New Zealand media reported items falling and buildings swaying. According to the northernmost of New Zealand’s sub-antarctic islands, Geonet, the quake was reported at a depth of 33 km (21 miles) about 160 km north-west of Snares Islands. Meanwhile, the United States Geological Survey said the quake, which was downgraded from an earlier magnitude of 7, happened at a depth of about 10 km (6 miles).

The Chief Adviser said this while addressing the nation on the occasion of Independence Day and upcoming Eid-ul-Fitr on Tuesday evening. He said the previous Awami League government has taken the corruption to the top of the world. Corruption not only increases costs incredibly but also destroys all the efforts of the government and the people and it makes meaningless all goals, policies, institutional arrangements of the government as well as the responsibilities of its officials, he said in a televised address to the nation on the eve of the great Independence and Eid-ul-Fitr. He said the government, businessmen, industrialists, investors and all the citizens of the country have to work according to these unwritten rules (corruption). The Chief Adviser said citizens have to strive to become experts in the art of survival by dealing with it. Noting that the whole world has understood that we as a nation do not carry the identity of honesty, Yunus said this is not only a matter of national disgrace, but it is a suicidal issue in international trade. “Like the countrymen, the international community also wants us to be free from corruption, because they want to expand trade and commerce with us. If we cannot be free from corruption, trade and commerce will not progress. Bangladesh has no way without being free from corruption,” he said.

politics,https://www.risingbd.com/english/politics/news/111259,India to reduce tariffs on U.S. products worth $23billion,2025-03-25,"India is willing to reduce tariffs on over half of U.S. imports valued at $23 billion in the initial phase of a trade deal currently under negotiation. This move, the most significant tariff cut in years, is aimed at preventing retaliatory US tariffs. With US President Donald Trump’s new reciprocal tariffs set to take effect on April 2, global markets have been rattled, and policymakers, including those in Western nations—are rushing to respond. The South Asian nation wants to mitigate the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump’s reciprocal worldwide tariffs set to take effect from April 2, a threat that has disrupted markets and sent policymakers scrambling, even among Western allies. According to an internal analysis by India, the new US tariffs could affect 87% of Indian exports to the US, valued at approximately $66 billion, two government officials said. To avoid this impact, India is open to lowering tariffs on 55% of US imports that are currently taxed between 5% and 30%, according to sources. Some of these tariffs may be reduced significantly, while others could be entirely removed. A US delegation, led by Brendan Lynch, Assistant US Trade Representative for South and Central Asia, is set to visit India for trade talks beginning Tuesday. The Indian government hopes to finalize a deal before the US reciprocal tariffs take effect. During Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the US in February, both nations agreed to begin early trade talks to resolve tariff disputes. However, India’s willingness to lower tariffs hinges on whether the US will ease reciprocal tariffs, according to officials.

The Chief Adviser said this while addressing the nation on the occasion of Independence Day and upcoming Eid-ul-Fitr on Tuesday. “Confidence has been restored in the banking system. As a result of this, discipline has been restored in the economy while it was very much important among the attainments of the interim government,” he said. Extending warm greetings to the countrymen ahead of the Holy Eid-ul-Fitr, he said that the current interim government has taken strong measures to control the prices of essentials as the big challenges during the Holy Month of Ramadan and before the Eid-ul-Fitr was reining in the prices of essentials and thus ensuring the power supply. “We’ve tried our best so that the price of any product doesn’t increase during this Ramadan and there is no interruption in the power supply,” he said. Mentioning that his government has taken all sorts of measures to strongly overcome the hurdles in the supply chain during this Holy Month, Prof Yunus said news have already come from all corners of the country that the commodity prices remained less during this Ramadan compared to the past while people also got comfort. “This effort will continue to control commodity prices,” he added.

The wildfires began late on Friday in Sancheong county in Northern Gyeongsang province before spreading to neighbouring Uiseong county – located about 180km (111 miles) southeast of the capital Seoul – and have advanced into Andong, Cheongsong, Yeongyang, and Yeongdeok counties. The Korea Forest Service said firefighters were fighting at least five active wildfires nationwide as of Wednesday morning. The death toll jumped to 24 on Wednesday as wind-driven flames tore through neighbourhoods and razed an ancient temple, officials said. Among those killed was a pilot of a firefighting helicopter who died when his aircraft crashed in a mountain area in Uiseong. Officials in Andong and other southeastern cities and towns have ordered residents to evacuate as firefighters struggle to contain the fires, which have burned more than 17,000 hectares (42,000 acres) of forest and destroyed hundreds of structures, including the more than 1,000-year-old Gounsa temple in Uiseong. National treasures stored at the Buddhist temple, which was built in 681, were moved to safety in other areas of the country, Yonhap said.

politics,https://www.risingbd.com/english/politics/news/111276,Escalating threat of AI-powered cyber attacks and strategies for,2025-03-26,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the digital world, offering advancements that were once the realm of science fiction. However, it’s also becoming a double-edged sword. While AI helps enhance cyber security defenses, it’s also being used as a weapon by cybercriminals to conduct more sophisticated and effective attacks. AI-powered cyber threats can easily bypass traditional security measures, making them more dangerous than ever. This article demonstrates how AI is being used in cyber attacks and the best strategies to defend against them. How AI is Used in Cyber Attacks 1. AI-Enhanced Phishing Attacks: Phishing has always been a major cyber threat, but in today’s world, AI has made it more dangerous. Traditional phishing emails often contain grammatical errors or generic messaging, making them easier to detect. However, AI-powered phishing campaigns use machine learning to observe a target’s social media, emails, and online activities to craft highly personalized emails. These AI-generated emails are indistinguishable from legitimate communications. Incident: According to news.com.au, in 2023, cyber criminals exploited artificial intelligence to conduct sophisticated phishing attacks, notably targeting the travel industry. They used AI to create convincing fake booking emails that mimicked legitimate communications from reputable companies like Booking.com. This led to a significant increase in travel-related scams, with Australians losing over $337,000 in that year alone. 2. AI-Driven Malware and Ransomware: AI enables malware to adapt and evolve, making detection and mitigation more challenging. This intelligent malware can learn from the environment, modify it’s behavior to avoid detection, and even identify high-value targets within a network. Incident: According to The Hacker News, in January 2025, the AI-driven ransomware FunkSec attacked over 85 organizations worldwide, using AI to automate attacks and optimize ransom demands. They used double extortion tactics, encrypting data while threatening to leak sensitive information if the ransom wasn’t paid. 3. Deepfake Impersonations: The emergence of deepfake technology has introduced a new way for cyber attacks. By creating realistic audio and video impersonations, attackers can deceive individuals into exposing sensitive information or authorizing fraudulent transactions. NativeClick Ads Incident: According to India Today, in November 2023, scammers used deepfake technology to impersonate a retired police officer, blackmailing a 74-year-old man into paying $1,000 by threatening him with fake charges. 4. AI-Powered Botnets and DDoS Attacks: AI has enhanced the capabilities of botnets—networks of compromised computers used to launch large-scale Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. These botnets can adapt their strategies in real time, making mitigation more complex. Incident: According to the World Economic Forum, in May 2024, the FBI dismantled a global botnet that had infected millions of computers across nearly 200 countries. This botnet facilitated numerous cybercrimes, including financial scams, identity theft, bomb threats, and access to child exploitation materials. Government and Policymaker Responses As cyber threats continue to evolve, governments and policymakers around the world have been ramping up their efforts to mitigate the growing risks posed by AI-powered cyber attacks. 1. Regulatory Frameworks and Policies: Governments are developing regulations to ensure the responsible use of AI and to protect against its malicious applications. European Union (EU): The EU is advancing the Artificial Intelligence Act, aiming to establish comprehensive guidelines for AI development and deployment, including stringent requirements for high-risk AI systems. United States: The Cyber Security and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has outlined efforts to integrate AI considerations into federal cyber security strategies, emphasizing the need for trustworthy AI in government operations. 2. International Collaboration: Cyber threats are borderless, prompting international cooperation to combat AI-driven cybercrime. Agencies like Europol are collaborating with global partners to share intelligence, coordinate responses, and develop unified strategies against these evolving threats. 3. Investment in AI Research and Development: Governments are investing in AI research to stay ahead of cybercriminals. This includes funding for developing AI tools capable of detecting and countering AI-driven attacks, as well as fostering public-private partnerships to leverage industry expertise. Defensive Strategies for Organizations Organizations must adopt proactive measures to defend against AI-powered cyber threats. 1. Implementation of AI-Based Security Solutions: Leveraging AI for defense involves deploying systems that can detect anomalies, predict potential threats, and respond in real-time. These AI-driven security solutions can analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns indicative of cyber threats. 2. Adoption of a Zero Trust Security Model: The Zero Trust model operates on the principle that no entity, internal or external, should be automatically trusted. Continuous verification and strict access controls are enforced to minimize potential attacks. 3. Continuous Employee Training: Human error remains a significant vulnerability. Regular training programs can educate employees about the latest phishing techniques, the dangers of deepfakes, and best practices for maintaining cyber security hygiene. Protective Measures for the General Public Individuals also play a crucial role in the cyber security ecosystem. By adopting certain practices, the general public can mitigate the risks posed by AI-driven cyber threats. 1. Vigilance Against Phishing Attempts: Being cautious of unsolicited communications and verifying the authenticity of requests can prevent falling victim to phishing scams. 2. Utilization of Strong, Unique Passwords: Employing complex passwords and changing them regularly reduces the risk of unauthorized access. Using password managers can assist in maintaining unique credentials across multiple platforms. 3. Awareness of Deepfake Technology: Understanding that audio and video can be manipulated is essential. Being skeptical of unexpected requests, especially those involving financial transactions or sensitive information, is prudent. Conclusion Cyber security is no longer just about firewalls and antivirus software—it’s about adapting to a world where AI is both the strongest defense and the most powerful weapon. As the saying goes, ""To fight AI, you need AI."" The future of cyber security depends on our ability to harness technology for defense as effectively as attackers use it for offense.

politics,https://www.risingbd.com/english/politics/news/111282,US govt agency recommends blacklisting India,2025-03-26,"The US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) has urged the White House to designate India as a “country of particular concern,” and impose targeted sanctions on RAW, India’s external spy service, for gross violations of religious minority rights. The Indian government, run by Hindu nationalist BJP party, has been engaging in and tolerating systematic, ongoing, and egregious religious freedom violations, says the USCIRF report released late Tuesday. In the run up to the general elections in June 2024, the ruling party used hateful rhetoric as well as disinformation against Muslims and other minorities to gather votes from the Hindu majority. The malpractice fueled vigilante and arbitrary communal attacks both before and after the elections. Upon election, the BJP-run government exploited laws to also target human rights activists, civil society members and journalists, many a times for speaking on behalf of the religious minorities. Numerous building authorities, including the Delhi Development Authority, took steps for the demolition and seizure of minority assets. The Ram Temple was built a razed mosque, and consecration of the temple was followed by a series of minority attacks, the report notes.

politics,https://www.risingbd.com/english/politics/news/111290,Trump announces 25% tariffs on foreign-built vehicles,2025-03-27,"US President Donald Trump has announced new import taxes of 25% on cars and car parts coming into the US in a move that threatens to widen the global trade war, the BBC reported. Trump said the latest tariffs would come into effect on 2 April, with charges on businesses importing vehicles starting the next day. Charges on parts are set to start in May or later. The president claimed the measure would lead to ""tremendous growth"" for the car industry, promising it would spur jobs and investment in the US. But analysts have said the move is likely to lead to the temporary shutdown of significant car production in the US, increase prices, and strain relations with allies. The US imported roughly eight million cars last year, accounting for about $240bn (£186bn) in trade and roughly half of overall sales. Mexico is the top foreign supplier of cars to the US, followed by South Korea, Japan, Canada and Germany. Trump's latest move threatens to upend global car trade and supply chains. Many US car companies have operations in Mexico and Canada as well, set up under the terms of the longstanding free trade agreement between the three countries. The White House said the order would apply not only to finished cars but also to car parts, which are often shipped in from other countries before getting assembled in the US. NativeClick Ads However, the new tariffs on parts from Canada and Mexico are exempt while US customs and border patrol set up a system to assess the duties, the White House said. The neighbouring countries see goods worth billions cross borders each day. On Wednesday, shares in General Motors slid roughly 3%. The sell-off spread to other companies, including Ford, after the president's remarks as he confirmed the tariffs. Asked at a press conference if there was any chance he would reverse course, Trump said no, adding later: ""This is permanent."" ""If you build your car in the United States there is no tariff,"" he said. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said his government would put ""all options on the table"" in response to the tariffs. Japan, which is home to several major motor industry giants, is the world's second largest exporter of cars. Shares in Japanese carmakers - including Toyota, Nissan, Honda - fell in early trade in Tokyo.

Hamas spokesperson Abdel-Latif al-Qanoua was killed when Israeli fighter jets bombed his tent shelter in the northern city of Jabalia in the early hours of Thursday morning, according to Al-Aqsa television and the Shehab News Agency. Several more people were wounded in the strike, including children, according to Hind Khoudary, an Al Jazeera correspondent in Gaza. Khoudary said the attack was one of several carried out by the Israeli military across the Strip over recent hours, including a strike on a home in the as-Saftawi area of Gaza City, which killed six members of the same family. On March 18, Israel abruptly ended a fragile two-month ceasefire as it resumed its intense bombing campaign and ground operations in Gaza. Israel has since killed hundreds of Palestinian civilians in an attempt to pressure Hamas into freeing the remaining captives held in the war-torn enclave. Several senior Hamas officials have also been killed over the past week. On Sunday, an Israeli air strike on the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis in southern Gaza killed five people, including Ismail Barhoum, the head of finances and institutions within Hamas’s political office.",israel kill hama spokesperson abdellatif,hama spokesperson kill isra air strike northern gaza new outlet confirm israel armi continu renew assault besieg enclav hama spokesperson abdellatif awami leagueqanoua kill isra fighter jet bomb tent shelter northern citi jabalia earli hour thursdai morn accord alaqsa televis shehab new agenc sever peopl wind strike includ child accord hind khoudari al jazeera correspond gaza khoudari say attack on sever carri isra militari across strip recent hour includ strike home assaftawi area gaza citi kill six member famili march 18 israel abruptli end fragil twomonth ceasefir resum intens bomb campaign grind oper gaza israel sinc kill hundr palestinian civilian attempt pressur hama free remain captiv hold wartorn enclav sever senior hama offici also kill past week sundai isra air strike nasser hospit khan youni southern gaza kill five peopl includ ismail barhoum head financ institut within hama polit offic,hama spokesperson kill isra air strike northern gaza new outlet confirm israel armi continu renew assault besieg enclav hama spokesperson abdellatif awami leagueqanoua kill isra fighter jet bomb tent shelter northern citi jabalia earli hour thursdai morn accord alaqsa televis shehab new agenc sever peopl wind strike includ child accord hind khoudari al jazeera correspond gaza khoudari say attack on sever carri isra militari across strip recent hour includ strike home assaftawi area gaza citi kill six member famili march 18 israel abruptli end fragil twomonth ceasefir resum intens bomb campaign grind oper gaza israel sinc kill hundr palestinian civilian attempt pressur hama free remain captiv hold wartorn enclav sever senior hama offici also kill past week sundai isra air strike nasser hospit khan youni southern gaza kill five peopl includ ismail barhoum head financ institut within hama polit offic,8,peopl_student_univers_gaza,0.06060606060606061,0.09696969696969697,0.03636363636363636,0.07272727272727272,0.18181818181818182,0.048484848484848485,0.048484848484848485,0.37575757575757573,0.03636363636363636,0.04242424242424243

We must chart a clear roadmap for a shared future and shared prosperity,” he said while addressing Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) conference in Hainan on Thursday (March 27) morning. About financial cooperation, the Chief Adviser said, “Asia must create a sustainable financing mechanism. We need reliable funds that address our challenges and meet our growing demands.” Regarding trade cooperation, he said Asia remains one of the least integrated regions. This weak integration stifles investment and trade. We must work to boost trade cooperation immediately, he noted. About food and agriculture cooperation, Prof Yunus said the Asian countries must promote resource-efficient farming and domestic production must be enhanced for food security. “We need to reduce import reliance and achieve self-sufficiency. Expanding tech-based sustainable agricultural solutions and innovation in regenerative and climate-smart farming is key,” he said. The Chief Adviser said Asia must build a strong tech ecosystem, which should be restorative, distributive and inclusive. “We need to share knowledge and data, and invest in technology incubation and innovation. Collaboration on digital solutions will drive progress,” he said.

politics,https://www.risingbd.com/english/politics/news/111294,Adani fully restores power supply to Bangladesh,2025-03-27,"Bangladesh said Indian billionaire Gautam Adani’s power generation unit resumed full electricity supply to the nation, four months after halving the feed over unpaid dues, the Economic Times reported. “We’re making regular payments to Adani and receiving power as per our requirements,” Rezaul Karim, chairman of Bangladesh Power Development Board, said on Thursday. He didn’t specify the quantum of payments and whether past arrears have been cleared. Data from BPDB shows Adani increased power supply more than two weeks ago. Adani Power Ltd. had halved supply from its 1,600 megawatt coal-fired plant in India’s Jharkhand state in November after a series of missed payments by Dhaka, which was battling a foreign exchange crisis amid a turbulent change of regime. Restoration of supply will help Bangladesh avoid blackouts in the sweltering summer months when temperatures can reach 38C (100.4F) or more. Shares of the company extended gains after the report, climbing as much as 2% in Mumbai. The stock has declined nearly 5% so far this year. The dues, which had at one point crossed $850 million, now stands at $800 million and the same would be cleared in next six months, people familiar with the matter said. The BPDB had also provided guarantees to reassure Adani’s lenders to ease the company’s working capital crunch, they said, requesting not to be named as the information is private. A representative of the Adani Group did not immediately respond to a request for comments. The restoration of power is a step to help repair business ties between the two nations.

Zelensky made these remarks during an interview with European journalists on March 26 in Paris, amid persistent rumours about Putin's health. “He [Putin] will die soon, and that’s a fact, and it will come to an end,” Zelensky said. The Ukrainian leader’s blunt assessment follows years-long rumors about the Russian strongman’s health woes — including reported strokes, multiple bouts of cancer and even Parkinson’s disease. The statement is a bold one, given the ongoing conflict and the sensitivity surrounding the health of world leaders. Zelensky offered up the prediction, too, as he pleaded with the US to “stay strong” — and not cave to the Kremlin’s demands during ongoing peace and cease-fire negotiations.

Prof Yunus said financial issues over the Rooppur power plant have been sorted out, with Bangladesh repaying the money in an account in Dhaka. He said the Rooppur power plant is expected to start generating power on a trial basis by the end of this year. The Chief Adviser said Bangladesh would import more wheat and fertiliser from Russia.

The Red Sea Governorate said the submarine, named ""Sindbad"", had 50 people onboard: 45 tourists of different nationalities from Russia, India, Norway, and Sweden, and five Egyptian crew members. ""Most of those on board were rescued and taken to their hotels and hospitals in Hurghada,"" the Russian consulate in Hurghada said. The submarine was equipped with large portholes to let passengers see the Red Sea's spectacular corals and marine life, and was able to descend to a depth of 25 metres, according to the company's website. The pleasure craft was a far cry from the extreme adventure submersible that imploded thousands of metres below the Atlantic near the sunken Titanic in June 2023. The Red Sea is a major hub for Egypt's crucial tourism industry, a pillar of the economy, in which Russian tourists play an increasing part. Egypt also attracts tourists with its great pyramids of Giza and cruises on the Nile in Luxor and Aswan. Successive Egyptian governments have waged successful crackdowns on Islamist militant groups who hurt the tourism industry with attacks on foreigners in the past. Egyptian authorities are conducting investigations with crew members to determine the causes of the submarine sinking, the local governorate cited Red Sea Province Governor Amr Hanafy as saying. NativeClick Ads The submarine, which is owned by an Egyptian, was licensed and so was the crew captain, he said. There have been several recent incidents of tourist boats capsizing.

politics,https://www.risingbd.com/english/politics/news/111311,Barcelona beat Osasuna to move three points clear in LaLiga,2025-03-28,"Barcelona eased to a 3-0 home win against Osasuna to move three points clear of defending champions Real Madrid in LaLiga, reports Aljazeera. Despite resting key forwards Robert Lewandowski and Raphinha, the Catalan club raced into a two-goal lead through a Ferran Torres tap-in and a Dani Olmo penalty – after a retake. Second-half substitute Lewandowski headed home the third in the 77th minute to wrap up a sixth-straight win for Barca. In truth, it could and should have been a lot more for the home side, whose unbeaten run in all competitions has extended to 19 games. “Every match is a final from now on and today wasn’t different. We solved it quickly and soundly and that’s the important thing. Three points and move on,” first-goal scorer Torres told reporters. Torres opened the scoring for the home side in the 11th minute with a first-time finish from inside the six-yard box as he met with Alejandro Balde’s cross in a terrific team goal. Olmo extended the lead 10 minutes later from the penalty spot after he was fouled while attempting to round the Osasuna keeper. It took two efforts to find the goal for Olmo, whose first kick was saved but had to be retaken after an Osasuna player was found to have encroached in the area. NativeClick Ads Osasuna failed to register an effort on goal in the first period while conceding 78 percent of the possession at the same time. Lewandowski’s close-range header wrapped up the win as the Polish striker netted his 23rd goal of the season only seven minutes after coming on.

politics,https://www.risingbd.com/english/politics/news/111320,Maradona was in agony in the hours before his death,2025-03-28,"One of two forensic experts who performed Diego Maradona’s autopsy has told a court in Buenos Aires that the Argentinian football legend suffered ‘agony’ for at least 12 hours before he died. The results of the autopsy were made public for the first time on Thursday amid the trial of seven doctors and nurses who treated him at his Buenos Aires home before his death in 2020. The trial started on Tuesday. “The heart was completely covered in fat and blood clots, which indicate agony,” Carlos Cassinelli, director of forensic medicine at the Scientific Police Superintendency, told the court. The autopsy concluded that Maradona died from acute pulmonary oedema secondary to congestive heart failure. He was not a patient who should have been treated at home, Cassinelli added. “This is a patient who had been collecting water over the days that’s not acute. This was something that was foreseeable,” he said. “Any doctor examining a patient would find this.” According to the prosecution, the accused professionals – a neurosurgeon, a psychiatrist, a psychologist, doctors, and nurses – who were caring for Maradona during his convalescence, failed to provide adequate medical care, which allegedly led to his death.

politics,https://www.risingbd.com/english/politics/news/111323,"Climate change poses severe threats to Bangladesh, urgent action needed",2025-03-28,"Bangladesh is rich in natural resources. The fertility of the soil and the temperate climate allow for abundant crop production. Due to industrialization, the country has not faced significant difficulties. Our labor is cheap, which has made us known for our productivity. However, without any fault of our own, we are facing consequences due to climate change. The industrialized nations are responsible for carbon emissions. Bangladesh is not significantly responsible for global climate change, yet we are the ones suffering the most. Although the climate has been changing since the beginning, the effects have just become apparent in recent decades. It is impacting Bangladesh with increased extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and food insecurity, necessitating adaptation strategies like building seawalls, diversifying crops, and investing in early warning systems. Bangladesh ranks at the top of the list of countries affected by climate change. According to the Global Climate Risk Index published by the international research organization Germanwatch in 2010, Bangladesh is the most impacted country in terms of damage caused by climate change among the top ten-affected nations. The survey was conducted on 193 countries from 1990 to 2009. It is worth noting that in the reports published by the same organization in 2007 and 2008, Bangladesh was also identified as the most affected country. Scientists say that if global warming continues at the same rate, a large area of Bangladesh will be flooded in the next 100 years, and about 30 million people will become refugees. Due to the country's geographical location, population density, and economic structure, Bangladesh will be severely impacted by the negative effects of climate change. Numerous statistics clearly indicate that significant changes are occurring and will occur in the country's ecosystems and the livelihoods of its people as a result of climate change. Experts say climate change has become a global crisis. The changing climate is increasingly posing a significant challenge to the existence of human civilization. It is an issue that does not respect the boundaries of countries, nations, subcontinents, or continents. The impacts of climate change are already being felt, and urgent action is needed to reduce vulnerability and build resilience. Climate Change and its Impact in Bangladesh According to environmental scientists, Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by global warming. The major natural disasters that have been occurring in Bangladesh in recent times are mainly due to climate change. Following are the top effects in Bangladesh. They are Changed Natural seasonal characteristics, decreasing natural resources in Bangladesh, Sea Level Rise, Biodiversity Destruction, Flash floods, Drought, Decrease in River Flow and Increase in Salinity of Water, Ocean Storms and Tidal Surges, etc. Severe Impact on Agriculture Agriculture is the lifeblood of Bangladesh's economy. The economy and livelihoods of Bangladesh are built on four pillars, one of which is agriculture. Climate change is having a significant negative impact on agriculture. The agricultural sector is considered the most vulnerable industry. This is because its productivity entirely depends on factors such as temperature, rainfall, solar radiation, sunlight duration, and climate-related conditions. The average rainfall in Bangladesh has significantly increased compared to previous years. This average annual rainfall is expected to rise further by 2030. More than 80% of the land in Bangladesh is flood-prone. Floods caused by tidal surges cause extensive damage in coastal areas. Currently, around 1.5 million hectares of land in Bangladesh are affected by floods each year. In hilly regions, excessive rainfall erodes the fertile topsoil of elevated areas, gradually diminishing the soil's fertility and making it increasingly unsuitable for crop production. NativeClick Ads Another major barrier to crop production in Bangladesh is drought, which is becoming more pronounced due to climate change. Drought occurs when the rate of evaporation exceeds that of precipitation in a particular area. In Bangladesh, 60% of the 8.3 million hectares of arable land affected by different levels of drought is used for cultivating Aman rice. Additionally, crops such as Aus and Boro rice, jute, pulses, oilseeds, potatoes, sugarcane, and winter vegetables are severely impacted by drought conditions. The number of floods is gradually increasing, this is also an effect of climate change: Photo: Collected River erosion is increasing due to climate change. As a result, a lot of productive agricultural land is disappearing into the riverbed. According to a survey by the Bangladesh Water Development Board, 1,200 kilometers of riverbanks have been eroded so far and another 500 kilometers are at risk of erosion. Agriculture in Bangladesh is facing various threats such as irregular and insufficient rainfall, insufficient irrigation water due to low water tables, floods in coastal areas at various times besides the monsoon season, increased salinity due to rising sea levels, and land being submerged in water. Affecting human health Climate change is impacting health in a myriad of ways, including by leading to death and illness from increasingly frequent extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, storms and floods, the disruption of food systems, increases in zoonoses and food-, water- and vector-borne diseases, and mental health issues. In Bangladesh leading to increased risks of infectious diseases, heat-related illnesses, and mental health issues, exacerbated by extreme weather events and environmental degradation. What can we do While developed nations bear the primary responsibility for climate change, it is imperative that the global community collaborates to address this pressing issue. Our contribution should focus on implementing comprehensive afforestation initiatives. Trees play a crucial role in absorbing harmful carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen, thereby helping to maintain environmental balance. The initiation of afforestation programs should be prioritized in coastal and riverine regions of the country. This will mitigate riverbank erosion and lessen the severity of sea storms. Concurrently, it is essential to halt deforestation. In addition, efforts must be directed towards reducing the emissions of harmful gases that contribute to atmospheric warming. Industries should prioritize energy conservation and adopt measures to treat waste effectively. Bangladesh is prone to natural disasters, with various types occurring annually. As climate change intensifies, these disasters are expected to become more severe in the coming years. Therefore, it is crucial to raise awareness and prepare adequately for the challenges ahead. Experts Opinion Dr. Mohammad Tarikul Islam, Professor of Government and Politics at Jahangirnagar University, Bangladesh said that, The Government of Bangladesh has made a few significant moves in recent years to establish institutional frameworks for efficient and organized disaster management and easing the suffering of disaster and climate victims. But Bangladesh is a disaster-prone nation. We are now at great risk for various reasons. He stated like other countries of the Global South, climate change has elicited a rise in extreme weather phenomena such as floods, droughts, extreme temperatures, heavy rains, and storms. Climate change events are more frequent, and impact all facets of human existence. Dr. Mohammad Tarikul Islam said, beyond city innovations, there are opportunities to learn from and collaborate with neighboring countries. Through mutual cooperation, the nations of South Asia could help each other adapt to difficult situations, learn from one another, and even prosper. Having consistently supported the Global South in gatherings like COP, the G20, and the Voice of the Global South Summit, both India and Bangladesh have institutional expertise they may draw upon therefore, they should leverage resources to solve their common concerns and raise their voices on the international scene by putting up a single front. Dr Rejaul Karim, Associate professor of Varendra University said, at the global stage, Bangladesh is engaged in climate diplomacy, promoting the need for more ambitious objectives to limit the increase in global temperatures and to assist vulnerable countries, including itself. The Global Goal on Adaptation, a significant result of the Paris Agreement, seeks to bolster the resilience of nations like Bangladesh through both financial and technical assistance. Furthermore, he emphasized that tackling the climate crisis necessitates more than just local initiatives. Bangladesh has been a strong proponent of climate finance, calling on developed countries to honor their obligations to the Green Climate Fund and other international support frameworks. Global collaboration is essential, particularly as Bangladesh's adaptation strategies demand considerable investment.",climat chang pose sever threat bangladesh urgent action need,bangladesh rich

The meeting held at the Chinese capital’s Great Hall of the People discussed issues of mutual interest, with President Xi Jinping reiterating China’s full support for the Chief Adviser and the reform agenda of the Interim Government. Bestowing a rare honour to the Bangladesh leader, President Xi came out from his office to greet Prof Yunus as he arrived at the Great Hall, accompanied by two advisers. Later, the two leaders led their respective sides in a bilateral meeting, marked by warmth and candour. It was the first bilateral visit by the Chief Adviser to a foreign country. Describing Bangladesh as an important neighbour of China, President Xi Jinping offered to share Beijing’s development experiences and boost cooperation with Bangladesh to help it grow fast. The Chinese President said China would continue to grant zero-tariff facilities to Bangladeshi goods and extend the status until the end of 2028- two years after Bangladesh’s scheduled graduation from a least developed country. He said Beijing would like to start negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement and Investment Agreement with Dhaka to pave the way for more Chinese investment in the South Asian nation. President Xi said his government would encourage more Chinese private investment and relocation of Chinese manufacturing plants to Bangladesh after the Chief Adviser Prof Yunus sought his active support for this major shift in Chinese investment policy. NativeClick Ads The Chinese President said China would support building an exclusive Chinese industrial economic zone and industrial parks in Bangladesh. He welcomed more Bangladeshi products to China and “high-quality” cooperation in BRI projects, as well as the digital and maritime economy. The Chinese president welcomed more Bangladeshis to seek treatment in hospitals in Yunnan and other provinces of China. China has also announced it would build a specialised hospital in Bangladesh. The Chief Adviser said Bangladesh wants to elevate its relationship with China to a new height. He also sought Chinese support in resolving the Rohingya crisis. President Xi reiterated China’s support for the repatriation of the forcibly displaced people of Myanmar who have taken shelter in Bangladesh. Prof Yunus sought China’s support for young people’s dreams to create a new Bangladesh and invited Beijing to set up a China cultural centre in Bangladesh. He also sought a cut in interest rates for Chinese project loans and a waiver of the commitment fees charged on the borrowing. Xi recalled his two visits to Bangladesh and said he studied microcredit, pioneered by Prof Yunus, when he was the governor of Fujian province. He said China would give a positive consideration to the issues raised by the Chief Adviser. He said he tasted Bangladeshi mango and jackfruit and appreciated their quality, as China is poised to import the fruits from the country. The two leaders also discussed China’s support for the Teesta River project, the purchase of multiple-role combat aircraft and multimodal transport connectivity linking the southern Chinese city of Kunming with Bangladeshi ports. “Today, we witnessed history in the making. This is a transformational visit, and the two leaders have laid a solid foundation for intensified strategic ties, which will last through decades,” said Dr. Khalilur Rahman, High Representative of the Chief Adviser, who is on the Bangladesh delegation to China.

The shallow 7.7-magnitude quake struck northwest of the city of Sagaing in central Myanmar on Friday causing massive destruction across large parts of the country. The powerful quake hit northwest of Myanmar’s Sagaing at 12:50 pm (0650 GMT) on Friday at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres (six miles). It was followed minutes later by a powerful 6.7-magnitude aftershock and a dozen smaller tremors. The quake was felt across the region, with shaking reported from India to the west and China to the east, as well as Cambodia and Laos.

The quake hit along the Sagaing Fault that runs from the coast to Myanmar’s northern border, according to earthquake scientists Judith Hubbard and Kyle Bradley.

USGS’s predictive modelling estimated the death toll could exceed 10,000 people in Myanmar, and that losses could be greater than the value of the country’s gross domestic product. Susan Hough, a scientist in the USGS’s Earthquake Hazards Program, said it was difficult to predict an earthquake’s death toll, for various reasons including timing. When an earthquake strikes during the daytime, as it did in Myanmar, “people are awake, they have their wits about them, they are better able to respond,” she said. The USGS said at least 14 aftershocks hit Myanmar after a 7.7-magnitude earthquake. Meanwhile, international aid began to arrive in Myanmar on Saturday as rescuers searched for survivors after a powerful earthquake devastated the Southeast Asian nation amid concerns the number killed would soar.

politics,https://www.risingbd.com/english/politics/news/111348,Myanmar junta continues airstrikes after devastating quake,2025-03-30,"Myanmar’s military junta has carried out airstrikes in the war-torn country following the major earthquake there, which has killed more than 1,600 people. The UN has described the attacks as “completely outrageous and unacceptable”. Special Rapporteur Tom Andrews told the BBC that it was “nothing short of incredible” that the military was continuing to “drop bombs when you are trying to rescue people” after the earthquake. He called on the military regime, which seized power in a coup nearly four years ago to stop all military operations. “Anyone who has influence on the military needs to step up the pressure and make it very clear that this is not acceptable,” he said. “I’m calling upon the junta to just stop, stop any of its military operations,” he added. BBC Burmese confirmed that seven people were killed in an air strike in Naungcho in northern Shan state. This strike took place around 15:30 local time, less than three hours after the quake struck. Pro-democracy rebel groups that are fighting to remove the military from power have reported aerial bombings in Chang-U township in the north-western Sagaing region, the epicentre of the quake. There are also reports of airstrikes in regions near the Thai border. NativeClick Ads The National Unity Government (NUG), which represents the ousted civilian administration, said in a statement that its armed forces would begin a two-week pause in “offensive military operations, except for defensive actions” in areas affected by the earthquake, from Sunday. The 7.7 magnitude earthquake that struck Sagaing was also felt in neighbouring countries. It was followed by reports of destruction coming from nearby Mandalay – Myanmar’s second largest city - as well as the capital, Nay Pyi Taw, which is more than 150 miles (241km) away. The junta says 1,644 people are known to have died and many more are believed to be trapped under rubble.

politics,https://www.risingbd.com/english/politics/news/111364,Trump says he `couldn`t care less` about higher car prices,2025-03-30,"Donald Trump has said he ""couldn't care less"" if carmakers raise prices after his 25% tariffs on foreign-made vehicles comes into effect, reports BBC. Some analysts have warned that Trump's import charges could lead to the temporary shutdown of some US car production, with increased prices passed onto consumers. But the US president told NBC News on Saturday that he hoped foreign carmakers will raise prices as it meant ""people are gonna buy American-made cars - we have plenty"". On Wednesday, Trump announced new 25% tariffs on cars and car parts entering the US to begin on 2 April. Charges on businesses importing vehicles are expected on 3 April, and taxes on parts are set to start in May or later. When asked about what his message was to car bosses, he said: ""The message is congratulations. If you make your car in the United States, you're going to make a lot of money."" He continued: ""If you don't, you're going to have to probably come to the United States, because if you make your car in the United States, there is no tariff."" Recent polling by BBC's US partner CBS News suggests that consumers are worried the tariffs will raise prices, with 72% indicating that they believe costs will increase in the short-term. More than half of respondents said the Trump administration is not focusing enough on lowering costs for Americans. Asked about this sentiment on Sunday, Trump's senior counsellor for trade and manufacturing Peter Navarro asked people to put their trust in the US president._Agencies.

Let’s take a closer look at what Trump said about Putin in that NBC News interview. ""You could say that I was very angry, pissed off, when... when Putin started getting into Zelensky's credibility, because that's not going in the right location,"" Trump reportedly told the US news outlet. He was responding to comments Putin made on Friday, that suggested Zelensky does not have the legitimacy to conduct peace talks, with the Russian leader floating the idea of placing Ukraine under UN control. In a phone call with NBC on Sunday, the US president said: ""New leadership means you're not gonna have a deal for a long time."" Trump also threatened to impose extra tariffs on countries buying Russian oil if Putin did not agree to a ceasefire. ""If Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia's fault - which it might not be... I am going to put secondary tariffs... on all oil coming out of Russia,"" Trump is reported as saying. But later on Sunday, Trump told reporters he and Putin had ""always gotten along well"" and that he didn't think Putin was ""going to go back on his word"".

politics,https://www.risingbd.com/english/politics/news/111376,"Loss and Damage, a growing concern for South Asia",2025-03-31,"South Asian countries including Bangladesh face immense and irreversible losses because of climate change. But support from developed countries is lacking. Loss and damage, with progress being minimal amidst fluctuating interests. The wealthy world has created the climate crisis, while the poorer nations, which emit very little carbon, are suffering the most. Addressing climate change requires financing, yet as the UN climate summit COP29 approaches, there is still no sign of funding. Progress has been limited at the event held in Baku, Azerbaijan. Climate experts have called on countries to take swift, effective, and collective action. All negotiations at the climate conference seem to be stuck on the issue of financing. Despite much talk about money, the tangible outcomes are minimal. While affected nations strive to bring about change, they are met with resistance. As a result, environmental activists expressed their frustration throughout the day in Baku. Many placards during the protests echoed the term ‘greenwash’ which means misleading people by concealing the truth. Environmentalists lack confidence in the grand promises made by leaders from various countries to reduce global temperatures during discussions at the conference. Representatives from affected countries, including Bangladesh, have openly voiced in various forums and press conferences that developed nations are failing to fulfill their commitments. They argue that a handful of wealthy countries, having recklessly burned coal, oil, and gas for years, have pushed the rest of the world into danger, only to now stall on compensation. Many are skeptical about the intentions behind wealthy nations' efforts to involve private capital in financing measures to combat climate change. At the last 29 climate conferences, affected countries have demanded $100 billion annually, yet global leaders have repeatedly broken their promises. Many argue that these are developed countries, but what kind of development are we talking about? They are major polluters, historically responsible for severe carbon emissions. They are obligated to provide this compensation to help save the planet. However, this funding or financing must not be conditional in any way, nor should it involve loans or contracts. It cannot be used to impose carbon credits, new hazardous technologies, or seeds. This fund must be secured to support the climate adaptation efforts of Bangladesh's rural population, which depend on local and diverse approaches, as well as to compensate for overall damage. New funding raises concerns At the COP29 conference, wealthy countries, including the European Union and the United States, have agreed to provide $300 billion annually to climate funds by 2035. The conference, originally scheduled to conclude on November 22, 2024, has been extended to November 23 due to protracted discussions among 200 nations. These lengthy negotiations aim to finalize a global climate fund plan for the next decade based on consensus. On November 22, a draft agreement for a $250 billion fund was proposed at the COP29 conference, chaired by Azerbaijan. However, developing nations rejected this amount as ‘offensively low’. The current proposal is intended to succeed the $100 billion funding commitment set to expire in 2025. However, discussions are ongoing not only about the total amount of funding but also about who will contribute and how much of it will be in the form of grants. Nonetheless, a comprehensive outcome has yet to be achieved, leaving various countries in a state of concern. Several wealthy countries, including the European Union, have suggested that other economically powerful nations, such as China and oil-rich Gulf states, should also be included in funding contributions. NativeClick Ads Meanwhile, developing countries argue that inadequate funding will hinder their ability to set ambitious targets for reducing carbon emissions. A group of developing nations has threatened to withdraw from the discussions if a final decision on the proposal is not reached. In order to address the increasing pressures from climate change-related damages, developing countries have been calling for an increase in funding. If wealthy nations fail to fulfill their commitments through this proposal, divisions in future climate conferences may deepen further. What constitutes loss and damage resulting from climate change? The consequences of climate change manifest as increasingly frequent and severe floods, heatwaves, storms, and rising sea levels. While some individuals can adapt to these environmental changes, there are numerous situations where adaptation is not feasible: lives are lost, protective barriers are breached, land becomes unproductive, habitats undergo irreversible changes, and livestock perish. The unavoidable social and economic repercussions of climate change are termed ""loss and damage."" Loss and damage can be categorized into economic and non-economic types. Economic losses encompass financial detriments experienced by businesses, such as the significant heatwaves in India that have led to decreased wheat yields, adversely impacting the livelihoods of numerous farmers. This category also includes the destruction of property and infrastructure, exemplified by homes being swept away in increasingly severe floods. Non-economic loss and damage may involve the tragic loss of lives, as well as the erosion of cultural traditions, indigenous knowledge, biodiversity, and essential ecosystem services. What is the impact of loss and damage on Bangladesh and South Asia? From 2019 to 2023, approximately 82.1 million individuals were affected by weather-related disasters in South Asia, as reported by the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters. In 2022, South Asia accounted for the majority of natural disaster-related fatalities in Asia, largely due to the ""unprecedented"" floods in Pakistan that year, which impacted an estimated 33 million people. Numerous reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have highlighted South Asia's heightened vulnerability to extreme weather events. As global temperatures rise, the frequency and intensity of such disasters are expected to increase, potentially leading to significant loss and damage for the South Asian region. Considering the significant economic and humanitarian consequences of these changes, the methods by which the world assesses and compensates for loss and damage are critically important for the future of South Asia and all developing nations. With lives and livelihoods on the line, countries in this region and beyond are advocating for meaningful global discussions on loss and damage to facilitate their recovery and prepare for future challenges. What level of loss and damage will South Asia endure due to climate change? A study published in Nature in April 2024 projected that South Asia could face a median income reduction of 22% by 2050 as a result of climate change effects. Additionally, a 2018 study conducted by Australia’s Crawford School of Public Policy estimated that a 3°C increase in global temperatures above pre-industrial levels could lead to a 2.1% decline in India’s GDP by 2037, escalating to 5.5% by 2067. As of 2022, nearly 65% of South Asians resided in rural areas reliant on agriculture, which constitutes 18% of the region's gross domestic product (GDP) and accounts for 42% of total employment. However, agriculture is significantly impacted by climate change, affecting crop yields, exacerbating market prices, and heightening regional food insecurity. A pivotal 2022 IPCC report on climate impacts highlighted those economic losses from floods, cyclones, and heatwaves, along with gradual crises such as diminishing agricultural productivity, would have a profound effect on South Asia. It is important to note that South Asia is already incurring substantial costs due to extreme weather events. A study by the NGO Germanwatch ranked India as the seventh most affected country by extreme weather in 2019, reporting that severe floods that year resulted in approximately USD 10 billion in damages, claiming 1,800 lives and displacing around 1.8 million individuals. Each year, Bangladesh and other South Asian nations also endure significant destruction from tropical cyclones. Although advancements in weather forecasting have considerably decreased the loss of life, homes and livelihoods are consistently devastated with each storm. Super cyclone Amphan, which struck India and Bangladesh in 2020, resulted in estimated losses of around USD 14 billion, displacing 2.4 million individuals in India and 2.5 million in Bangladesh. Four years later, cyclone Remal impacted the same area, leading to damages estimated at approximately USD 600 million, affecting sectors such as fisheries, housing, and infrastructure. As climate change progresses, such extreme weather events are expected to become increasingly severe and unpredictable, complicating the ability of meteorologists to provide timely warnings as storms form. A 2019 study, using 2005 price levels, projected that climate change-related loss and damage could cost South Asia USD 518 billion by 2050, with estimates potentially rising to USD 997 billion by 2070. Climate change threatens lives and futures of over 19 million children in Bangladesh. Photo Source Unicef Why is loss and damage a contentious topic? Loss and damage have emerged as a divisive issue in international climate discussions, primarily due to concerns regarding liability and compensation. Developed nations, which have historically contributed the most to greenhouse gas emissions since the industrial revolution, have been hesitant to agree to any international framework that could obligate them to compensate for the losses and damages caused by their emissions. In principle, such an agreement was established in 2023 during the UN’s annual climate change COP (Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change). Held in Dubai, COP28 saw the establishment and funding of a loss and damage fund. However, the initial financial commitments represented less than 0.2% of the total annual losses faced by developing countries. What does the Paris Agreement state regarding loss and damage? Article 8 of the Paris Agreement, which was signed in 2015 at COP21, addresses loss and damage. It emphasizes that the countries that are parties to the agreement acknowledge “the importance of averting, minimizing, and addressing loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change,” and they are encouraged to enhance collaboration in implementing effective solutions. The incorporation of specific language regarding loss and damage in the Paris Agreement provided a formal acknowledgment that developing nations had advocated for however, the manner in which it was articulated favored the interests of developed countries. Paragraph 52 of the decision accompanying the Paris Agreement clearly states: “Article 8 of the Agreement does not involve or provide a basis for any liability or compensation.” Consequently, the Paris Agreement does not impose any legally binding responsibilities on nations to tackle loss and damage related to climate change, nor does it specify any financial obligations to assist countries experiencing significant loss and damage. What is the extent of funding allocated for loss and damage? As the United Nations gradually works towards establishing a sufficient loss and damage fund, some independent initiatives have emerged to aid vulnerable nations. In 2021, a coalition of philanthropic organizations, spearheaded by the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, contributed USD 3 million towards a loss and damage finance facility. Additionally, during COP26 that same year, the Wallonia region of Belgium committed EUR 1 million (approximately USD 1.1 million), while Scotland, the host nation, pledged GBP 2 million (around USD 2.6 million). Nevertheless, these contributions are minimal compared to the projected financial needs. The 2019 publication, Loss and Damage from Climate Change, estimates that developing countries will require between USD 290 billion and USD 580 billion annually by 2030 to address loss and damage. This estimate, co-edited by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria and the London School of Economics, is based on 2005 price levels and reflects a broad range due to various potential emissions-reduction scenarios. Is the establishment of a sufficient loss and damage fund feasible? At COP28 in Dubai, developed nations pledged approximately USD 700 million towards the new loss and damage fund. This commitment included contributions from the United Arab Emirates, Germany, Italy, France, Japan, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Slovenia, the European Union, and the United States. This amount represents less than 1% of the projected USD 400 billion that developing nations need annually to address the losses and damages resulting from climate change. In light of this inadequate advancement, specialists from the Global South have started advocating for greater ambition through the New Collective Quantified Goal. Should this initiative gain traction in upcoming climate change conferences and negotiations, it has the potential to deliver a minimum of USD 1 trillion each year to developing countries, offered as grants and concessional financing. Looking forward to COP 30 The Government of Brazil will host the thirtieth Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC (COP 30), with a view to building on previous successes and paving the way for future ambition to effectively tackle the global challenge of climate change. COP30 will take place in Belém, Brazil, from 10-21 November this year, with the themes include: reducing greenhouse gas emissions. adaptation to climate change. climate finance for developing countries. To ensure that fund can effectively respond to the needs of people and communities affected by climate change, all countries must work together. At the COP-29 conference, important discussions took placed on how to provide financial assistance through various innovative methods, including bonds and insurance. The G7 countries, known as the Global Shield, also discussed pre-planned insurance and other financial support for low-income countries affected by climate disasters such as floods, droughts, and hurricanes. Additionally, there have been suggestions in recent conferences to divert attention from the true 'loss and damage' fund to some grants. Most representatives from poorer countries have expressed a desire for grants, not loans or insurance, as these could further increase the debt burden on countries in South and Southeast Asia. Moreover, the pledges made by wealthy nations are not sufficient. Some countries alone require several trillion dollars in assistance to address the damage caused by climate change. Neither wealthy countries nor international financial management can adequately solve these challenges. Naturally, the affected countries are looking ahead to COP-30. They will seek resolutions on the unfinished issues from recent conferences and assurances for funding from developing countries, including those in South Asia. Experts Opinion Md. Shamsuddoha from Bangladesh's climate research organization (CPRD) states that Western countries now plan to profit from climate change. This development worker notes that they have significant surplus capital and are looking to invest in poorer nations under the guise of carbon trading. There is a growing suspicion that a form of carbon capitalism is beginning to take shape. Environmental activist Syeda Rizwana Hasan, who is currently serving as Environment, Forest and Climate Change Adviser to the interim government of Bangladesh, stated that it is not possible to wait until 2030 to take effective action against climate change. Advocating for justice for those affected by climate change, she emphasized that developed countries must urgently reduce emissions to meet the 1.5 degrees Celsius target and fulfill their commitments under the Paris Agreement. She also highlighted how Bangladesh, as a climate-vulnerable country, is confronting the realities of climate change every day, underscoring the need for coordinated global initiatives. Syeda Rizwana Hasan noted that in 2024, two devastating floods caused $1.7 billion in damages in Bangladesh, equivalent to 1.8 percent of the national budget. Over the past 18 months, Bangladesh has been affected by 15 climate-related natural disasters, displacing 1.2 million people. Despite contributing only 0.4 percent to global greenhouse gas emissions, the country suffers extreme losses. She further stated that Bangladesh has set a target to reduce emissions by 22 percent by 2030, which includes an unconditional reduction of 27 million tons and a conditional reduction of 61 million tons. Achieving these targets will require $45 billion in domestic funding and $135 billion in international assistance. Developed countries need to strengthen their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) based on climate justice, reduce reliance on market mechanisms, and uphold their commitments to high-quality

The Israeli military said in a statement that it attacked a Hezbollah militant ""who had recently directed Hamas operatives and assisted them."" The attack took place a few days after a previous strike by Israel on the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital, a Hezbollah stronghold known as the Dahiyeh. There was no immediate statement from Hezbollah on the identity of the target. Lebanese President Joseph Aoun condemned the latest Israeli airstrike on Tuesday, calling it a ""dangerous warning"" that signals premeditated intentions against Lebanon. Aoun said Israel's growing ""aggression"" requires Lebanon to intensify diplomatic outreach and mobilise international allies in support of the country's full sovereignty. Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam also condemned the Israeli strike and said it was a flagrant breach of U.N. Resolution 1701 and the ceasefire arrangement. Nawaf said that he has been closely monitoring the aftermath of the strike in coordination with the ministers of defence and interior. The strike appeared to have damaged the upper three floors of a building in Beirut's southern suburbs, a Reuters reporter at the scene said, with the balconies of those floors blown out.

politics,https://www.risingbd.com/english/politics/news/111395,"NY Times report on Bangladesh misleading, says CA press wing",2025-04-01,"The New York Times article titled ""As Bangladesh Reinvents Itself, Islamist Hard-Liners See an Opening"" is a misleading one, said the Chief Adviser's Press Wing today (April 1). ""The New York Times article paints a troubling and one-sided view of Bangladesh, suggesting that the country is on the brink of being overtaken by religious extremism,"" the press wing said in a statement posted on its verified Facebook page - CA Press Wing Facts. This portrayal not only oversimplifies the political and social dynamics of the country but also risks unfairly smearing an entire nation of 180 million people, it mentioned. It is crucial to acknowledge the progress Bangladesh has made over the last year and the complexity of the situation, rather than relying on selective, incendiary examples that paint an inaccurate picture, according to the statement. Following is the detail of the statement: 1. Acknowledging Bangladesh's Progress and Challenges: While the article highlights certain incidents of religious tension and conservative movements, it overlooks the broader context of progress. Bangladesh has made substantial strides in improving the conditions for women, and the Interim Government has been particularly committed to their security and well-being. This is a government that has prioritised women's rights and security, a focus that stands in stark contrast to the bleak image painted in the article. One significant example is the ""Youth Festival 2025,"" where nearly 2.7 million girls from all corners of the country participated in 3,000 games and cultural activities. NativeClick Ads This widespread participation-across regions, marginalised communities, and even indigenous youth-underscores the thriving and dynamic engagement of women and girls in Bangladesh's social and cultural life. The fact that one soccer game faced opposition does not erase the success of the other 2,999 events, which were celebrated by countless participants and communities. To focus on a single interruption to one event misrepresents the vibrancy and determination of the country's youth, especially women. Another claim that Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus ""has not pushed back hard enough against extremist forces"" is not only false, but it also disregards his lifelong commitment to empowering women. As Chief Advisor Prof Yunus has been unwavering in his advocacy for women's rights. A father of two daughters, Yunus has built his entire career and the Grameen Bank around a deep belief in the power of women, which ultimately earned him the Nobel Prize. His dedication to advancing women's rights and protecting their freedoms is a cornerstone of his work and reputation. 2. Correcting Misconceptions About Religious Violence: In a country like Bangladesh, it is important to distinguish between political unrest and religious violence. Many of the clashes between different groups in the wake of Sheik Hasina's departure and since have been misrepresented as sectarian violence, when in reality, they were largely political in nature. Political factions often use religion to galvanise support, which complicates the issue and risks conflating political unrest with religious persecution. It is misleading to frame the entire situation as a sectarian conflict, as it ignores the true political and socio-economic factors at play. The Interim Government has made clear its commitment to protecting all minority communities, and its ongoing work with law enforcement and counterterrorism efforts underscores this commitment. Bangladesh's efforts to combat extremism through social reforms and collaboration with the international community should not be overshadowed by the spread of misinformation. 3. Bangladesh's Role on the Global Stage: Bangladesh is quietly transforming into one of Asia's economic powerhouses, with a growth trajectory that promises immense opportunities for global investors. Against all odds, Bangladesh's economy has stabilised, showing remarkable resilience. In the last seven months, exports have grown almost 12%. The banking sector has remained intact after the political upheaval, and the local currency exchange rate has held steady at around 123 BDT to the USD. Looking ahead, Bangladesh is projected to advance to become a middle income country by 2026, and potentially the world's 9th largest consumer market by 2030. Where is the recognition of the incredible work done by the 84-year-old Muhammad Yunus over the past eight months? He has been tirelessly crisscrossing the globe to secure a better future for Bangladesh. Just last week, during his visit to China, the Chinese government and businesses committed US$2.1 billion in loans, investments, and grants to Bangladesh. And next week, Dhaka will host the Investors Conference, bringing over 2,300 participants from 50 countries, including top officials from global companies like Meta, Uber, and Samsung. The world is increasingly recognising Bangladesh as a rising economic power. This is a story of hope, strength, and unprecedented opportunity-one that deserves to be told with the respect and attention it merits. 4. Avoiding Oversimplification and Smearing a Nation: The NY Times article provides a handful of incidents, such as the release of a man who hurled abuse at a woman, to paint a picture of a country spiraling into extremism. This approach is not only misleading but harmful. In a nation of 180 million people, it is unconscionable to define the entire country by a few isolated events. Bangladesh is a diverse and dynamic society with a rich history of resilience, culture, and progressive thought. Bangladesh is not alone in facing the challenge of religious extremism this is a global issue that many countries confront in different forms. However, Bangladesh has continuously worked to address these challenges through law enforcement, social reforms, and counterterrorism initiatives. The country's commitment to protecting its diverse population-whether Muslim, Hindu, Christian, or any other community-remains steadfast. While there will always be hardliners who spew hatred at rallies and on social media, it is our responsibility to deny them the oxygen their anger requires. Furthermore, the notion that the rise of extremism is an inevitable outcome of Bangladesh's political transition is far too deterministic. The country's democratic spirit and vibrant civil society are powerful forces that continue to hold back the full rise of extremist ideologies. While challenges remain, the long-term direction of Bangladesh will not be shaped solely by the actions of extremists. The people of Bangladesh, particularly its youth and women, are determined to continue the fight for a just, democratic, and inclusive society. Finally, Bangladesh's history of resilience, its commitment to democracy, and its focus on women's empowerment are all testaments to the fact that the country will continue to move forward, despite the challenges it faces. Rather than focusing on a few negative examples, we should recognise the broader picture of progress, resilience, and determination that defines Bangladesh today._BSS.",ny time report bangladesh

politics,https://www.risingbd.com/english/politics/news/111401,Israel kills Hezbollah official in Beirut airstrike,2025-04-02,"An Israeli airstrike killed a Hezbollah official and three others in Beirut’s southern suburbs on Tuesday, a Lebanese security source said, further testing a shaky ceasefire between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah, Reuters reported. The Israeli military said the official - Hassan Bdeir - was a member of a Hezbollah unit and Iran’s Quds Force, and he had assisted the Palestinian group Hamas in planning a “significant and imminent terror attack against Israeli civilians”. The attacks on Beirut’s southern suburbs have resumed at a time of broader escalation in the region, with Israel having restarted Gaza strikes after a two-month truce and the United States hitting the Iran-aligned Houthis of Yemen in a bid to get them to stop attacking Red Sea shipping. Hezbollah lawmaker Ibrahim Moussawi said the Israeli attack amounted to “a major and severe aggression that has escalated the situation to an entirely different level”. Speaking in a televised statement after visiting the building that was struck, he called on the Lebanese state to “activate the highest level of diplomacy to find solutions”. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said the eliminated Hezbollah operative posed “a real and immediate threat”. “We expect Lebanon to take action to uproot terrorist organizations acting within its borders against Israel,” he said. Israel dealt severe blows to Hezbollah in the war, killing thousands of its fighters, destroying much of its arsenal and eliminating its top leadership, including Hassan Nasrallah. Hezbollah has denied any role in recent rocket attacks from Lebanon towards Israel, including one that prompted Israel to carry out an airstrike on the southern suburbs last Friday.",israel kill hezbollah offici beirut airstrik,isra airstrik kill hezbollah offici three other beirut southern suburb tuesdai lebanes secur sourc say test shaki ceasefir israel iranback hezbollah reuter report isra militari say offici hassan bdeir member hezbollah unit iran qud forc assist palestinian group hama plan signific immin terror attack isra civilian attack beirut southern suburb resum time broad escal region israel restart gaza strike twomonth truce unit state hit iranalign houthi yemen bid get stop attack red sea ship hezbollah lawmak ibrahim moussawi say isra attack amount major sever aggress escal situat entir differ level speak televis statement visit build strike call lebanes state activ high level diplomaci find solut isra foreign minist gideon saar say elimin hezbollah oper pose real immedi threat expect lebanon take action uproot terrorist organ act within border israel say israel deal sever blow hezbollah war kill thousand fighter destroi much arsen elimin top leadership includ hassan nasrallah hezbollah deni role recent rocket attack lebanon toward israel includ on prompt israel carri airstrik southern suburb last fridai,isra airstrik kill hezbollah offici three other beirut southern suburb tuesdai lebanes secur sourc say test shaki ceasefir israel iranback hezbollah reuter report isra militari say offici hassan bdeir member hezbollah unit iran qud forc assist palestinian group hama plan signific immin terror attack isra civilian attack beirut southern suburb resum time broad escal region israel restart gaza strike twomonth truce unit state hit iranalign houthi yemen bid get stop attack red sea ship hezbollah lawmak ibrahim moussawi say isra attack amount major sever aggress escal situat entir differ level speak televis statement visit build strike call lebanes state activ high level diplomaci find solut isra foreign minist gideon saar say elimin hezbollah oper pose real immedi threat expect lebanon take action uproot terrorist organ act within border israel say israel deal sever blow hezbollah war kill thousand fighter destroi much arsen elimin top leadership includ hassan nasrallah hezbollah deni role recent rocket attack lebanon toward israel includ on prompt israel carri airstrik southern suburb last fridai,5,pakistan_india_attack_say,0.18994413407821228,0.0335195530726257,0.1005586592178771,0.061452513966480445,0.22905027932960895,0.05027932960893855,0.0446927374301676,0.22346368715083798,0.027932960893854747,0.03910614525139665

Speaking at the White House, Trump flagged that India imposes a 52% tariff on US imports, describing it as “very tough”. Recalling his interaction with PM Modi on bilateral trade during his visit to the US in February, Trump said, “The Prime Minister just left. He’s a great friend of mine, but I said, ‘You’re a friend of mine, but you’re not treating us right’. They charge us 52%. We charge them almost nothing for years and years and decades.” The reciprocal tariff rate of 27% includes a 10% universal tariff. The universal 10% tariff will come into effect on all imports into the US from April 5, and the remaining 17% from April 10, a government official said. The move is likely to hurt India’s exports of agricultural and pharmaceutical goods to the US.

The highly anticipated tariff announcement sent shockwaves through markets, with global stocks sinking and investors scrambling to the safety of bonds as well as gold. Trump said he would impose a 10% baseline tariff on all imports to the United States and higher duties on some of the country's biggest trading partners. The new levies ratchet up a trade war that Trump kicked off on his return to the White House, rattling markets as fears grow that a full-blown trade war could trigger a sharp global economic slowdown and fuel inflation. The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against six others, fell 1.6% to 102.03, its lowest since early October. The euro, the largest component in the index, gained 1.5% to a six-month high of $1.1021. Trump has already imposed tariffs on aluminium, steel and autos, and has increased duties on all goods from China.

politics,https://www.risingbd.com/english/politics/news/111434,What economic experts are predicting about it in Bangladeshi?,2025-04-03,"Businessmen have expressed concern over the future of US President Donald Trump's 37 percent tariff on Bangladeshi exports, even though a decision has not yet been made. Besides, the experts said that an understanding must be reached with the US administration is needed as soon as possible to overcome this situation. At the same time, alternative markets for ready-made garments and other export products must be found. Experts and business leaders opined that Trump's tariffs will increase inflation in the United States, reducing the purchasing power of the country's citizens. This will reduce garment exports. It will take time to overcome this crisis by exporting ready-made garments to new markets, according to the experts. Economists in the country said that the United States has increased tariffs not only on Bangladeshi products but also on products from various countries around the world. There is a risk of inflation in the country due to the imposition of high tariffs. As inflation rises and consumer purchasing power declines, there is also a risk that the US economy will fall into a recession. As the United States is the top destination for ready-made garment exports, exports will decrease ultimately. It will have a negative impact on overall export earnings. However, if the government can reduce tariffs through negotiations with the US administration, the fear of a decline in export earnings would be fairly alleviated, experts opined. Former director of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), Md. Mohiuddin Rubel said, “The United States has imposed or increased additional tariffs on products from around 60 countries. It will have an impact on those countries. The purchasing power of US citizens will decrease, inflation will increase, which will not be good for the country. Businessmen are worried about this.” If the Bangladesh government works on this, tariffs could be reduced, he added. NativeClick Ads BKMEA Executive President Fazlee Shamim Ehsan opined that tariff wars are not desirable in the modern world. These tariffs will not bring much success to the American economy. The profit margin on our exported products is very low. The United States thinks these products will be made in the USA. That is not possible. As these industries are labor-intensive based industries.” Initially we will face a storm for this tariff. Because buyers are always opportunists. Buyers will try to reduce the price of our products, he added. Zahid Hossain, former chief economist at the World Bank's Dhaka office, said there is no doubt that the new US tariff policy will have a negative impact on Bangladesh's exports. In addition to its impact on Bangladesh, Trump's tariff war will also affect the US economy, he said.",econom expert predict bangladeshi,businessman express concern futur unit state presid donald trump 37 percent tariff bangladeshi export even though decis yet make besid expert say understand must reach unit state administr need soon possibl overcom situat time altern market readymad garment export product must find expert busi leader opin trump tariff will increas inflat unit state reduc purchas power countri citizen will reduc garment export will take time overcom crisi export readymad garment new market accord expert economist countri say unit state increas tariff bangladeshi product also product variou countri around world risk inflat countri due imposit high tariff inflat rise consum purchas power declin also risk unit state economi will fall recess unit state top destin readymad garment export export will decreas ultim will neg impact overal export earn howev governmentern can reduc tariff negoti unit state administr fear declin export earn fairli allevi expert opin former director bangladesh garment manufactur export associ md mohiuddin rubel say unit state impos increas addit tariff product around 60 countri will impact countri purchas power unit state citizen will decreas inflat will increas will good countri businessman worri bangladesh governmentern work tariff reduc ad nativeclick ad bkmea execut presid fazle shamim ehsan opin tariff war desir modern world tariff will bring much success american economi profit margin export product low unit state think product will make unit statesa possibl industri laborintens base industri initi will face storm tariff buyer alwai opportunist buyer will try reduc price product ad zahid hossain former chief economist world bank dhaka offic say doubt new unit state tariff polici will neg impact bangladesh export addit impact bangladesh trump tariff war will also affect unit state economi say,businessman express concern futur unit state presid donald trump 37 percent tariff bangladeshi export even though decis yet make besid expert say understand must reach unit state administr need soon possibl overcom situat time altern market readymad garment export product must find expert busi leader opin trump tariff will increas inflat unit state reduc purchas power countri citizen will reduc garment export will take time overcom crisi export readymad garment new market accord expert economist countri say unit state increas tariff bangladeshi product also product variou countri around world risk inflat countri due imposit high tariff inflat rise consum purchas power declin also risk unit state economi will fall recess unit state top destin readymad garment export export will decreas ultim will neg impact overal export earn howev governmentern can reduc tariff negoti unit state administr fear declin export earn fairli allevi expert opin former director bangladesh garment manufactur export associ md mohiuddin rubel say unit state impos increas addit tariff product around 60 countri will impact countri purchas power unit state citizen will decreas inflat will increas will good countri businessman worri bangladesh governmentern work tariff reduc ad nativeclick ad bkmea execut presid fazle shamim ehsan opin tariff war desir modern world tariff will bring much success american economi profit margin export product low unit state think product will make unit statesa possibl industri laborintens base industri initi will face storm tariff buyer alwai opportunist buyer will try reduc price product ad zahid hossain former chief economist world bank dhaka offic say doubt new unit state tariff polici will neg impact bangladesh export addit impact bangladesh trump tariff war will also affect unit state economi say,1,state_unit_say_trump,0.29411764705882354,0.02768166089965398,0.25259515570934254,0.03460207612456748,0.01730103806228374,0.031141868512110725,0.03460207612456748,0.020761245674740483,0.031141868512110725,0.2560553633217993

The court’s Acting Chief Justice Moon Hyung-bae opened the proceeding on Friday by declaring that there was sufficient reason to impeach President Yoon. “The defendant mobilised military and police forces to dismantle the authority of constitutional institutions and infringed upon the fundamental rights of the people,” the acting chief justice said while reading the court’s decision. “In doing so, he abandoned his constitutional duty to uphold the constitution and gravely betrayed the trust of the Korean people,” the chief justice said. “Such unlawful and unconstitutional conduct constitutes an act that cannot be tolerated under the constitution,” he said. “The negative consequences and ripple effects of these actions are substantial, and the benefit of restoring constitutional order through removal from office outweighs the national costs associated with the dismissal of a sitting president,” he added.

politics,https://www.risingbd.com/english/politics/news/111440,Holding polls at earliest possible time top priority: CA,2025-04-04,"Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus said holding the national elections at the earliest possible is at the top of his government’s agenda. “I have assured our people that, once our mandate is fulfilled in the conduct of elections as well as the required reform is done, we shall hold a free, fair and participatory election,” he said. The chief adviser made the remarks while speaking at the 6th Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) Summit in Bangkok, Thailand. Highlighting the aspects of the July uprising in Bangladesh, he said in 1971, hundreds of thousands of ordinary women and men, children and youth made supreme sacrifice in a nine-month long genocide, fighting against a brutal military. “Our people aspired for an inclusive, just and free society where every ordinary person could materialise his or her dreams. “Sadly, in the course of past fifteen years, our people, especially youth, progressively saw their spaces and rights curtailed. They witnessed deep erosion of almost every State institution and civic rights trampled,” Prof Yunus said. He said the common mass brought an end to the brutal authoritarian regime, at the expense of lives of close to 2,000 innocent people, mostly youth, including 118 children. “The people of Bangladesh witnessed a rebirth in her history,” he added. NativeClick Ads The chief adviser said the student leaders, who led the uprising and freed the country from the corrupt and autocratic regime of Sheikh Hasina, appealed to him to lead the country during this crucial juncture of the country’s history. “I agreed to take the responsibility, for the sake of our people,” he added. He said the interim government is pledged-bound to undertake robust and far-reaching reforms to restore economic stability and sustained growth. “We are committed to good governance, combating corruption and bringing order to every sphere of economy. These are at the core of the reforms we have planned,” Prof Yunus said. The interim government constituted six Commissions to recommend reforms to the judiciary, the electoral system, public administration, police, the anti-corruption office, and the constitution to ensure public ownership, accountability and welfare of the people, he said. The chief adviser said the commissions have already submitted their recommendations, which are under active consideration of the government. “We have formed a seven-member ‘Jatiya Oaikyamot (Consensus) Commission’ headed by me and comprising the chiefs of all the six Commissions to consider and adopt the recommendations submitted by the individual commissions,” he said. Prof Yunus said the interim government has also formed four additional commissions recently to make policy recommendations on media, health, labor and women’s rights. “As we rebuild Bangladesh, we will continue to work steadfastly to ensure the constitutional rights of every citizen of the country whether they are women or members of ethnic and religious minorities,” he said. Thai Prime Minister and Chairperson of the Summit Paetongtarn Shinawatra, BIMSTEC Secretary General Ambassador Indra Mani Pandey and distinguished heads of delegations from the BIMSTEC member states were present on the occasion.

politics,https://www.risingbd.com/english/politics/news/111441,CA urges BIMSTEC to work together for shared benefits,2025-04-04,"Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus on Friday (April 4) urged BIMSTEC to work together for mutuality of interests and shared benefits as he addressed the 6th BIMSTEC Summit here. “Bangladesh has long nurtured the vision of open regionalism. We envision a region where all the countries and communities can engage based on equity, mutual respect, mutuality of interests and shared benefits,” he said. The chief adviser said BIMSTEC region hosts one-fifth of the global population while challenges abound, converting those challenges into opportunities holding considerable prospect for all. “Many label our demography as a ‘challenge’. Yet, there are enough instances to illustrate the untapped ‘promises’ of our population,” he said. In hosting the BIMSTEC Secretariat, he said, Bangladesh stands ready to unlock the vast potential of an organisation in a meaningful way. About the potential of BIMSTEC, Prof Yunus said energy security is fundamental to the sustainable development and economic resilience of the BIMSTEC region. “We must work together to harness our collective potential in renewable energy, cross-border electricity trade, and energy efficiency to ensure a secure and sustainable future for our people,” he said. Prof Yunus said he is confident that the BIMSTEC Agreement on Grid Interconnection signed in 2018 can act as a launching pad for cooperation in the field of energy. NativeClick Ads “As per our BIMSTEC commitment we are committed to enhancing connectivity, improving mutual trade and economic collaboration among all member countries,” he said. He also said promoting trade and investment, facilitating movements of people particularly of the young boys and girls within BIMSTEC is key to enhancing wellbeing of their people. “Currently, intra-regional trade stands at just 5.9%. As the lead country in Trade, Investment and Development Sector, Bangladesh would urge all to materialise implementation of the BIMSTEC Framework Agreement on FTA that we signed way back in 2004, that will ultimately contribute towards better connectivity,” he said. The BIMSTEC Master Plan on Transport Connectivity was adopted at the fifth BIMSTEC Summit, the chief adviser said, adding that its timely implementation is crucial for the countries. He said: “Some of the countries have accomplished much bilaterally. In order to reap the benefits of effective regional economic integration and development, the regional measures need to be materialised.” Bangladesh stands ready to extend all possible support for the implementation of the Master Plan, he added. Prof Yunus said the BIMSTEC Agreement on Maritime Transport Cooperation was signed yesterday, which will certainly contribute towards enhanced connectivity within BIMSTEC region particularly with the landlocked member states and seven sisters of India. Noting that the BIMSTEC has been in existence for 28 long years, he said to be candid, its impacts are not still felt across the member states and beyond. He said signing and ratification of the Charter and formulation of the relevant Rules of Procedure has accorded the BIMSTEC processes and institutions considerable strength. “Our civil society and private sector particularly stress BIMSTEC to take up tangible and result-oriented initiatives, and projects amongst our countries,” the chief adviser said. As Bangladesh assumes the BIMSTEC Chairmanship, he called upon all member states to extend their valued support in redeeming their collective commitments to revitalise the organisation. “We need a genuinely shared sense of mutual confidence and mutuality of interests, rising above our differences and divergences. Whatever we undertake or do collectively, we need to be driven by impact and results,” he said. The chief adviser stressed rediscovering the modalities and institutions of regional and sub-regional collaboration under the BIMSTEC. Addressing inequality of income and choices, balancing economy and ecology need to be overriding objectives in pursuing their sectoral cooperation, he said. “While each of our countries pursue our national interests, we also need to appreciate the same of ‘others’ in the table in shaping and moving our wider cooperative agenda,” Prof Yunus said. In a fast-moving world, comparing the developments of the past decade seems a bit distant past, he said, adding many of long-held norms, regulations are giving in. “I find institutions often struggling to meet people’s aspirations. In making our institutions fit-for-purpose, I have been advocating for an overhaul of the financial system as also launch innovative social businesses that would uphold dignity and ensure an individual’s security, not just augment wealth,” he said. Within and beyond the region, resources - capacities - solutions abound to address many of our endemic challenges, like climate change, the chief adviser said. “As much as we facilitate knowledge and technology amongst our seven countries, let us also open up to the world – the governments, the knowledge institutions, foundations, private sector – who would share our values and appreciate our needs,” he added. Thai Prime Minister and Chairperson of the Summit Paetongtarn Shinawatra, BIMSTEC Secretary General Ambassador Indra Mani Pandey and distinguished heads of delegations from the BIMSTEC member states were present on the occasion.

Addressing the 6th BIMSTEC Summit in Bangkok on Friday (April 4), the chief adviser said the protracted Rohingya crisis, if remains unresolved, has the possibility to create instability in the whole region. He said BIMSTEC can promote dialogue to resolve the internal conflicts, particularly between the conflicting parties in Rakhine. It should take more visible actions to engage Myanmar to bring stability in Rakhine for an enabling environment for return of the forcibly displaced Rohingyas to Myanmar, Prof Yunus said. He said Bangladesh encourages meaningful participation of BIMSTEC member states in the “High-Level Conference on the Situation of Rohingya Muslims and Other Minorities in Myanmar’ under the UN auspices, in September, 2025. The chief adviser said Bangladesh expects high-level political participation in the conference from BIMSTEC member states.

The transition is scheduled to take place at the end of the 6th BIMSTEC Summit being held in Bangkok, Thailand, where leaders of the seven-member regional bloc-Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand-gathered to discuss pressing regional issues under the theme “Prosperous, Resilient, and Open BIMSTEC.” Bangladesh will take over the chairmanship from Thailand, which hosted this year’s summit.

politics,https://www.risingbd.com/english/politics/news/111450,India passes controversial bill on Muslim properties,2025-04-04,"After hours of heated debate, India's parliament has passed a controversial bill that seeks to change how properties worth billions of dollars donated by Muslims over centuries are governed, reports BBC. The upper house passed the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024 early on Friday, a day after the lower house cleared it amid strong opposition criticism. Muslim leaders and opposition parties say the bill is ""unconstitutional"" and infringes on the rights of India's Muslim-minority community. But the government says the bill aims to make the management of waqf (Muslim properties) more transparent. The bill will now be sent to India's president for her assent before it becomes law. This approval is expected to come soon. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the passing of the bill a ""watershed moment"". In a post on X, he said the waqf system [the system of governing waqf or Muslim properties] had been ""synonymous with a lack of transparency and accountability"" for decades. ""The legislation passed by parliament will boost transparency and also safeguard people's rights,"" he wrote. NativeClick Ads However, the opposition has been vociferous in their condemnation of the bill and allege that it is another ploy by the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to dilute the rights of minorities. Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge noted that while 288 members voted in favour of the bill in the lower house, a significant 232 opposed it. ""From this, we can guess that despite opposition from various parties, this bill was brought arbitrarily,"" he wrote on X. In Islamic tradition, a waqf is a charitable or religious donation made by Muslims for the benefit of the community. Such properties cannot be sold or used for any other purpose. They are important to India's 200 million Muslims as they are used for mosques, madrassas, graveyards and orphanages. The properties are governed by the Waqf Act, 1995, which mandated the formation of state-level boards to manage them. These boards include nominees from the state government, Muslim lawmakers, members of the state bar council, Islamic scholars and managers of waqf properties. Last August, the BJP government introduced a bill to amend the Waqf Act. The government said the changes proposed by the bill would modernise waqf administration and reduce legal loopholes. But Muslim leaders and opposition parties alleged that the amendments would give the government more control over these properties. The bill was sent to a panel for scrutiny. In February, the panel cleared the bill with some amendments._Agencies.",india pass controversi bill muslim properti,hour heat debat india parliament pass controversi bill seek chang properti worth billion dollar donat muslim centuri governmentern report bbc upper hous pass waqf bill 2024 earli fridai dai low hous clear amid strong opposit critic muslim leader opposit parti sai bill unconstitut infring right india muslimminor commun governmentern sai bill aim make manag waqf transpar bill will now send india presid assent becom law approv expect come soon prime minist narendra modi call pass bill watersh moment post x say waqf system system governmentern waqf muslim properti synonym lack transpar account decad legisl pass parliament will boost transpar also safeguard peopl right write nativeclick ad howev opposit vocifer condemn bill alleg anoth ploi governmentern bharatiya janata parti dilut right minor congress leader mallikarjun kharg note 288 member vote favour bill low hous signific 232 oppos can guess despit opposit variou parti bill bring arbitrarili write x islam tradit waqf charit religi donat make muslim benefit commun properti sell us purpos import india 200 million muslim us mosqu madrassa graveyard orphanag properti governmentern waqf act 1995 mandat format statelevel board manag board includ nomine state governmentern muslim lawmak member state bar council islam scholar manag waqf properti last august bjp governmentern introduc bill amend waqf act governmentern say chang propos bill modernis waqf administr reduc legal loophol muslim leader opposit parti alleg amend give governmentern control properti bill send panel scrutini februari panel clear bill amendmentsag,hour heat debat india parliament pass controversi bill seek chang properti worth billion dollar donat muslim centuri governmentern report bbc upper hous pass waqf bill 2024 earli fridai dai low hous clear amid strong opposit critic muslim leader opposit parti sai bill unconstitut infring right india muslimminor commun governmentern sai bill aim make manag waqf transpar bill will now send india presid assent becom law approv expect come soon prime minist narendra modi call pass bill watersh moment post x say waqf system system governmentern waqf muslim properti synonym lack transpar account decad legisl pass parliament will boost transpar also safeguard peopl right write nativeclick ad howev opposit vocifer condemn bill alleg anoth ploi governmentern bharatiya janata parti dilut right minor congress leader mallikarjun kharg note 288 member vote favour bill low hous signific 232 oppos can guess despit opposit variou parti bill bring arbitrarili write x islam tradit waqf charit religi donat make muslim benefit commun properti sell us purpos import india 200 million muslim us mosqu madrassa graveyard orphanag properti governmentern waqf act 1995 mandat format statelevel board manag board includ nomine state governmentern muslim lawmak member state bar council islam scholar manag waqf properti last august bjp governmentern introduc bill amend waqf act governmentern say chang propos bill modernis waqf administr reduc legal loophol muslim leader opposit parti alleg amend give governmentern control properti bill send panel scrutini februari panel clear bill amendmentsag,7,say_governmentern_parti_nation,0.13551401869158877,0.028037383177570093,0.11214953271028037,0.04205607476635514,0.08878504672897196,0.13551401869158877,0.3364485981308411,0.03271028037383177,0.02336448598130841,0.06542056074766354

sports,https://www.risingbd.com/english/sports/news/112396,NASA finds water in the air of exotic `sub-Neptune` exoplanet,2025-05-16,"NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has found water swirling in the air of a distant alien planet, a new study reports. That exotic world is TOI-421 b, a boiling-hot ""sub-Neptune"" orbiting a star about 244 light-years from Earth whose atmosphere JWST recently probed in detail, reports space.com. ""One of the most exciting prospects in exoplanet science today is discovering the origin and makeup of sub-Neptunes, which are high-occurrence planets that have no solar system analog,"" the study team wrote in their paper, which was published Monday (May 5) in The Astronomical Journal Letters. Although JWST was specifically designed for this kind of investigation, the discovery is particularly exciting because little is known about this class of planets, which were first identified by NASA's pioneering Kepler space telescope. Before JWST, attempts to study the atmospheres of sub-Neptune planets using transmission spectra — the measurement of starlight filtered through a planet's atmosphere when it passes in front of its host star — often yielded flat or featureless spectra. So, rather than showing chemical fingerprints that could indicate the presence of atmospheric molecules like carbon dioxide, methane or water vapor, the spectra of sub-Neptunes have generally offered little useful information. Astronomers proposed that this lack of detail might be due to clouds or hazes, which could be obscuring the signals. But the study team thought that TOI-421 b might be different, and could therefore offer a unique opportunity. Previous observations with NASA's Hubble Space Telescope had shown that flat spectral features are common among sub-Neptunes with temperatures below about 1,070 degrees Fahrenheit (577 degrees Celsius). ""Sub-Neptunes hotter [than this threshold] are also expected to be haze free because methane, and thus the hydrocarbon precursors to haze formation, should be less abundant as carbon monoxide becomes the dominant carbon-bearing molecule,"" the team wrote in the new study. NativeClick Ads TOI-421 b, with an estimated atmospheric temperature of 1,340 degrees Fahrenheit (727 degrees C), falls into this potentially haze-free category — and, after observing two transits using JWST's Near Infrared Spectrograph and Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph instruments, the team was rewarded with a rich atmospheric profile. ""We saw spectral features that we attribute to various gases, and that allowed us to determine the composition of the atmosphere,"" Brian Davenport, a Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland who conducted the primary data analysis, said in the same statement. The team detected water vapor in TOI-421 b's atmosphere, along with possible signs of carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide. Notably, they did not find evidence of methane or carbon dioxide. The data also suggest that the atmosphere contains a significant amount of hydrogen. Some of these findings are surprising, challenging existing theories about the formation and evolution of sub-Neptune planets. ""We had recently wrapped our mind around the idea that those first few sub-Neptunes observed by Webb had heavy-molecule atmospheres, so that had become our expectation, and then we found the opposite,"" said Kempton. This means TOI-421 b may have formed and evolved differently than cooler sub-Neptunes, such as TOI-270 d, which was observed previously. The hydrogen-rich atmosphere is especially intriguing because it closely mirrors the composition of TOI-421 b's host star._Agencies.",nasa find water air exot isubneptun exoplanet,nasa jame webb space telescop find water swirl air distant alien planet new studi report exot world toi421 b boilinghot subneptun orbit star 244 lightyear earth whose atmospher jwst recent probe detail report spacecom on excit prospect exoplanet scienc todai discov origin makeup subneptun highoccurr planet solar system analog studi team write paper publish mondai astronom journal letter although jwst specif design kind investig discoveri particularli excit littl know class planet first identifi nasa pioneer kepler space telescop jwst attempt studi atmospher subneptun planet us transmiss spectrum measur starlight filter planet atmospher pass front host star often yield flat featureless spectrum rather show chemic fingerprint indic presenc atmospher molecul like carbon dioxid methan water vapor spectrum subneptun gener offer littl us inform astronom propos lack detail may due cloud haze obscur signal studi team think toi421 b may differ therefor offer uniqu opportun previou observ nasa hubbl space telescop show flat spectral featur common among subneptun temperatur 1070 degre fahrenheit subneptun hot threshold also expect haze free methan thu hydrocarbon precursor haze format little abund carbon monoxid becom domin carbonbear molecul team write new studi nativeclick ad toi421 b estim atmospher temperatur 1340 degre fahrenheit fall potenti hazefre categori observ two transit us jwst near infrar spectrograph near infrar imag slitless spectrograph instrument team reward rich atmospher profil see spectral featur attribut variou gase allow u determin composit atmospher brian davenport phd student univers maryland conduct primari datum analysi say statement team detect water vapor toi421 b atmospher along possibl sign carbon monoxid sulfur dioxid notabl find evid methan carbon dioxid datum also suggest atmospher contain signific amount hydrogen find surpris challeng exist theori format evolut subneptun planet recent wrap mind around idea first subneptun observ webb heavymolecul atmospher becom expect find opposit say kempton mean toi421 b mai form evolv differ cool subneptun toi270 have observ previous hydrogenrich atmospher especi intrigu close mirror composit toi421 b host starag,nasa jame webb space telescop find water swirl air distant alien planet new studi report exot world toi421 b boilinghot subneptun orbit star 244 lightyear earth whose atmospher jwst recent probe detail report spacecom on excit prospect exoplanet scienc todai discov origin makeup subneptun highoccurr planet solar system analog studi team write paper publish mondai astronom journal letter although jwst specif design kind investig discoveri particularli excit littl know class planet first identifi nasa pioneer kepler space telescop jwst attempt studi atmospher subneptun planet us transmiss spectrum measur starlight filter planet atmospher pass front host star often yield flat featureless spectrum rather show chemic fingerprint indic presenc atmospher molecul like carbon dioxid methan water vapor spectrum subneptun gener offer littl us inform astronom propos lack detail may due cloud haze obscur signal studi team think toi421 b may differ therefor offer uniqu opportun previou observ nasa hubbl space telescop show flat spectral featur common among subneptun temperatur 1070 degre fahrenheit subneptun hot threshold also expect haze free methan thu hydrocarbon precursor haze format little abund carbon monoxid becom domin carbonbear molecul team write new studi nativeclick ad toi421 b estim atmospher temperatur 1340 degre fahrenheit fall potenti hazefre categori observ two transit us jwst near infrar spectrograph near infrar imag slitless spectrograph instrument team reward rich atmospher profil see spectral featur attribut variou gase allow u determin composit atmospher brian davenport phd student univers maryland conduct primari datum analysi say statement team detect water vapor toi421 b atmospher along possibl sign carbon monoxid sulfur dioxid notabl find evid methan carbon dioxid datum also suggest atmospher contain signific amount hydrogen find surpris challeng exist theori format evolut subneptun planet recent wrap mind around idea first subneptun observ webb heavymolecul atmospher becom expect find opposit say kempton mean toi421 b mai form evolv differ cool subneptun toi270 have observ previous hydrogenrich atmospher especi intrigu close mirror composit toi421 b host starag,3,countri_bangladesh_chang_climat,0.13793103448275862,0.07389162561576355,0.22167487684729065,0.1724137931034483,0.06896551724137931,0.07389162561576355,0.08374384236453201,0.059113300492610835,0.029556650246305417,0.07881773399014778

""We're in very serious negotiations with Iran for long-term peace,"" Trump said on a tour of the Gulf, according to a shared pool report by AFP. ""We're getting close to maybe doing a deal without having to do this... there (are) two steps to doing this, there is a very, very nice step and there is the violent step, but I don't want to do it the second way,"" he said. However, an Iranian source familiar with the negotiations said there were still gaps to bridge in the talks with the U.S. Oil prices fell by about $2 on Thursday on expectations of a U.S.-Iran nuclear deal that could result in sanctions easing. Talks between Iranian and U.S. negotiators to resolve disputes over Tehran's nuclear programme ended in Oman on Sunday with further negotiations expected, officials said, as Tehran publicly insisted on continuing its uranium enrichment. The Trump administration gave Iran a proposal for a nuclear deal during the fourth round of negotiations on Sunday, a U.S. official and two other sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Axios. But a senior Iranian official said Tehran had not received any fresh proposal from the United States to resolve the decades-long nuclear dispute, adding that Iran would never compromise on its right to enrich uranium on its soil. Though Tehran and Washington have both said they prefer diplomacy to resolve the dispute, they remain divided on several red lines that negotiators will have to circumvent to reach a new deal and avert future military action. NativeClick Ads In an interview with NBC News published on Wednesday, an adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Iran was willing to agree to a deal with the U.S. in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.

sports,https://www.risingbd.com/english/sports/news/112421,US wants to move 10 lakh Palestinians to Libya from Gaza,2025-05-17,"The Trump administration is working on a plan to permanently relocate as much as one million (10 lakh) Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to Libya, NBC News reported Friday, citing five people with knowledge of the matter. The plan is under serious enough consideration that the US has discussed it with Libya’s leadership, the report said, while stressing a final agreement has yet to be reached. In exchange for resettling the Palestinians, the administration would release to Libya billions of dollars of funds the US froze more than a decade ago, NBC added. According to three of the sources quoted in the report, Israel has been kept in the loop about the administration’s talks on the matter. “These reports are untrue,” an administration spokesperson told NBC in response. “The situation on the ground is untenable for such a plan. Such a plan was not discussed and makes no sense.” There was no response from Israel or either of Libya’s two rival governments the report, which also said administration officials have discussed offering incentives such as free housing and possibly a financial stipend to encourage Palestinians to leave Gaza for the North African country. An official told the US network that it remains unclear where one million Palestinians from Gaza could be settled in the largely lawless Libya, which has been plunged into chaos and division since the 2011 civil war in which longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi was overthrown and killed. The NBC report also noted the logistical challenges involved in transporting one million people from Gaza to Libya, particularly with no airport in the Strip. NativeClick Ads US President Donald Trump triggered global perplexity in early February by suggesting the US “take over” Gaza and turn it into a “Middle East Riviera” while forcing its Palestinian inhabitants to relocate to Egypt, Jordan, or other countries. He has since said, however, that no Gazans would be expelled. Visiting the Middle East this week, Trump said he wanted the United States to “take” Gaza and turn it into a “freedom zone”: “I have concepts for Gaza that I think are very good. Make it a freedom zone. Let the United States get involved and make it just a freedom zone,” he said. “I’d be proud to have the United States have it, take it, make it a freedom zone.” While far-right ministers in Israel have urged using the ongoing war with Hamas as an opportunity to reestablish Israeli settlements in the Strip lauded the plan, the Palestinian Authority and Arab nations rejected it outright. Despite public opposition among the region’s leaders, the government has moved forward with plans to encourage Palestinians to relocate, though The Times of Israel found no meaningful change in Israel’s exit policy for Gaza residents in recent months.",unit state want move 10 lakh palestinian libya gaza,trump administr work plan perman reloc much on million palestinian gaza strip libya nbc new report fridai cite five peopl knowledg matter plan seriou enough consider unit state discuss libya leadership report say stress final agreement yet reach exchang resettl palestinian administr releas libya billion dollar fund unit state freeze decad ago nbc ad accord three sourc quot report israel keep loop administr talk matter report untru administr spokesperson tell nbc respons situat grind unten plan plan discuss make sens respons israel either libya two rival governmentern report also say administr offici discuss offer incent free hous possibli financi stipend encourag palestinian leav gaza north african countri offici tell unit state network remain unclear on million palestinian gaza settl larg lawless libya plung chao divis sinc 2011 civil war longtim dictat moammar gadhafi overthrow kill nbc report also note logist challeng involv transport on million peopl gaza libya particularli airport strip nativeclick ad unit state presid donald trump trigger global perplex earli februari suggest unit state take gaza turn middl east riviera forc palestinian inhabit reloc egypt jordan countri sinc say howev gazan expel visit middl east week trump say want unit state take gaza turn freedom zone concept gaza think good make freedom zone let unit state get involv make just freedom zone say proud unit state take make freedom zone farright minist israel urg us ongo war hama opportun reestablish isra settlement strip laud plan palestinian author arab nation reject outright despit public opposit among region leader governmentern move forward plan encourag palestinian reloc though time israel find mean chang israel exit polici gaza resid recent month,trump administr work plan perman reloc much on million palestinian gaza strip libya nbc new report fridai cite five peopl knowledg matter plan seriou enough consider unit state discuss libya leadership report say stress final agreement yet reach exchang resettl palestinian administr releas libya billion dollar fund unit state freeze decad ago nbc ad accord three sourc quot report israel keep loop administr talk matter report untru administr spokesperson tell nbc respons situat grind unten plan plan discuss make sens respons israel either libya two rival governmentern report also say administr offici discuss offer incent free hous possibli financi stipend encourag palestinian leav gaza north african countri offici tell unit state network remain unclear on million palestinian gaza settl larg lawless libya plung chao divis sinc 2011 civil war longtim dictat moammar gadhafi overthrow kill nbc report also note logist challeng involv transport on million peopl gaza libya particularli airport strip nativeclick ad unit state presid donald trump trigger global perplex earli februari suggest unit state take gaza turn middl east riviera forc palestinian inhabit reloc egypt jordan countri sinc say howev gazan expel visit middl east week trump say want unit state take gaza turn freedom zone concept gaza think good make freedom zone let unit state get involv make just freedom zone say proud unit state take make freedom zone farright minist israel urg us ongo war hama opportun reestablish isra settlement strip laud plan palestinian author arab nation reject outright despit public opposit among region leader governmentern move forward plan encourag palestinian reloc though time israel find mean chang israel exit polici gaza resid recent month,1,state_unit_say_trump,0.33587786259541985,0.03435114503816794,0.13358778625954199,0.022900763358778626,0.05343511450381679,0.022900763358778626,0.11450381679389313,0.183206106870229,0.03816793893129771,0.061068702290076333

national,https://www.risingbd.com/english/national/news/112431,Indian authorities threw 43 Rohingya refugees into sea,2025-05-17,"Indian authorities have allegedly thrown 40 Rohingya refugees detained from New Delhi into international waters near the maritime border with Myanmar, forcing children, women, and the elderly to swim to safety with life jackets provided to them. The inhumane operation reportly happened on 08 May, the day Solicitor General assured the Supreme Court of India that any deportation would be carried out strictly in accordance with the procedure established by law. The United Nations has called for an investigation into “credible reports” that Indian authorities rounded up Rohingya refugees and expelled them, in some cases by putting them into the Andaman Sea off the shore of the same country they had escaped from, fearing persecution and death. “The idea that Rohingya refugees have been cast into the sea from naval vessels is nothing short of outrageous,” said Tom Andrews, the U.N. special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar. “I am seeking further information and testimony regarding these developments and implore the Indian government to provide a full accounting of what happened.” He urged the Indian government to refrain from “inhumane and life-threatening treatment of Rohingya refugees, including their repatriation into perilous conditions in Myanmar.” The Indian government did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Officials of right-wing governments across several Indian states rounded up thousands of Muslims, purportedly Rohingya or Bangladeshi people living illegally in India. Such labels, along with “Pakistani,” are often used to target Muslim migrants from other parts of India. The most sweeping actions were in Gujarat, in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home state, and in Rajasthan. While a majority of those detained turned out to be Indian citizens and were later released, those who were identified as Rohingya and Bangladeshi have been deported in large numbers, including some with refugee documents that were supposed to give them protection. The People’s Union for Civil Liberties, an India-based human rights group, criticized the move. “At the very least, the Rohingyas are entitled to due process under existing law which requires that the detainee get notice, opportunity of hearing and representation,” the group said in a statement. NativeClick Ads Rohingya refugees in Delhi said Indian authorities had rounded up dozens of them last week. They were taken to a police station, and never returned. Sadeq Shalom, a Rohingya Christian refugee in New Delhi who works as an education consultant, said his older brother and several other family members were picked up and were part of a group of 40 people who were put into the sea. He said 15 of the 40 were Christians, and their pleas that they faced double persecution — as Rohingya from the state, and then as a Christian minority from the Muslim majority in their area — were in vain. Another refugee in New Delhi, David Nazir, said his elderly parents were picked up and were also among the 40 people put to sea. He learned what had happened to them only after Mr. Shalom got a call from his brother, who borrowed a fisherman’s phone upon reaching Myanmar’s shore. “He told me that the Indian authorities had forced them off a navy vessel in the Andaman Sea and made them swim into Myanmar territory with nothing but life jackets,” Mr. Shalom said in an interview. Their biggest fear, Mr. Nazir said, was that the Myanmar army, which they had fled, was waiting for them. But in his phone call, Mr. Shalom’s brother said that all 40 were safe with the National Unity Government of Myanmar, which began operating in resistance after the country’s 2021 military coup. Colin Gonsalves, a lawyer representing the Rohingya in India’s supreme court, said there are about 1,000 who have sought refuge in Delhi and about 20,000 all over India. On social media, the Indian government’s actions drew comparisons to how India’s own immigrants were recently deported from the United States by the Trump administration, sent home by plane in shackles — a move that spurred widespread outrage. Mr. Gonsalves said that his appeal at the country’s supreme court to put a pause on the deportations was rejected. “We expect a little more compassion,” Mr. Gonsalves said. “Throwing refugees into the sea and then they land up in a war zone is one of the most barbaric practices a nation can indulge in.” Source: Agencies",indian author throw 43 rohingya refuge sea,indian author allegedli throw 40

The ISPR said that since 5 August last year, Naimul had been collaborating with several other dismissed or discharged ex-military personnel to make provocative statements in the media and plot subversive activities. “He planned a large-scale act of sabotage disguised as a protest rally at the entrance of Dhaka Cantonment on 18 May, and had been actively causing incitement through social media platforms,” reads the statement. To deter such disorderly conduct, a team from the army attempted to make contact with Naimul around 2:00pm on Saturday in the Khilkhet Bott Tola Bazar area. However, Naimul, along with several associates, allegedly launched a sudden attack with locally-made weapons on the military personnel present, said the ISPR. A nearby army patrol team quickly intervened, leading to the arrest of Naimul and two of his associates, the statement added. The ISPR also mentioned that Naimul had previously been dismissed from service due to multiple disciplinary violations, including allegations of demanding dowry from his wife, and committing both physical and mental abuse.
