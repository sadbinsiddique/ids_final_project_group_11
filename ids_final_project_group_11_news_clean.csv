Nine of the dead were children, said President Volodymyr Zelensky, who grew up in Kryvyi Rih. Local officials said a ballistic missile had hit a residential area. Images showed at least one victim lying in a playground, while a video showed a large section of a 10-storey block of flats destroyed and victims lying on the road. Russia’s defence ministry later claimed a “high-precision missile strike” had targeted a meeting of “unit commanders and Western instructors” in a restaurant, and that up to 85 were killed. It provided no evidence. Ukraine’s military responded by saying that Russia was spreading false information to try to “cover up its cynical crime”. It said Moscow had fired an Iskander-M ballistic missile with a cluster warhead to maximise casualties. The attack, early on Friday evening, was among the deadliest on Kryvyi Rih since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, and comes as US President Donald Trump pushes for a ceasefire. Zelensky wrote on social media that at least five buildings had been damaged in Friday's strike: “There is only one reason why this continues: Russia doesn't want a ceasefire, and we see it.” The head of Kryvyi Rih’s defence, Oleksandr Vilkul, said a residential area was hit. NativeClick Ads “The missile exploded in the air... to injure more people,” he said. “Children were killed on or near a playground.” Serhii Lysak, the head of the Dnipropetrovsk region where Kryvyi Rih is located, said more than 40 people were treated for wounds, and the youngest was only three months old. Later on Friday, Vilkul reported more explosions, saying the city was under a ""mass"" drone attack that triggered fires in at least four locations. He said one elderly woman burned to death in a private house hit by a drone. Another five people were injured elsewhere. Military chiefs from both the UK and France met Zelensky in Kyiv earlier in the day to discuss plans for foreign peacekeepers to be stationed in Ukraine as part of a potential ceasefire deal. But there has been little sign of a let-up in the violence. Kryvyi Rih also came under attack earlier this week when a building in the centre was struck, leaving four people dead. On Thursday, Russian drone strikes on the north-eastern city of Kharkiv claimed another five lives, local officials said. Kryvyi Rih is about 40 miles (70km) from the front line in eastern Ukraine and with a population of 600,000 it is reputed to be the longest city in Europe.","kill russian attack zelenski home citi","russian missil attack central ukrainian citi kryvyi rih kill less peopl leave dozen wind bbc report quot ukrainian offici nine dead child say presid volodymyr zelenski grow kryvyi rih local offici say ballist missil hit residenti area imag show less on victim ly playground video show larg section storei block flat destroi victim ly road russia’ defenc ministri late claim highprecis missil strike target meet unit command western instructor restaur kill provid evid ukraine’ militari respond sai russia spread fals inform try cover cynic crime say moscow fire iskanderm ballist missil cluster warhead maximis casualti attack earli fridai even among deadly kryvyi rih sinc start russia’ fullscal invas come u presid donald trump push ceasefir zelenski write social medium less five build damag fridai strike on reason continu russia want ceasefir see head kryvyi rih’ defenc oleksandr vilkul say residenti area hit nativeclick ad missil explod air injur peopl say child kill near playground serhii lysak head dnipropetrovsk region kryvyi rih locat say peopl treat wind young three month old late fridai vilkul report explos sai citi mass drone attack trigger fire less four locat say on elderli woman burn death privat hous hit drone anoth five peopl injur elsewher militari chief uk franc meet zelenski kyiv early dai discuss plan foreign peacekeep station ukrain part potenti ceasefir deal littl sign letup violenc kryvyi rih also come attack early week build centr strike leav four peopl dead thursdai russian drone strike northeastern citi kharkiv claim anoth five live local offici say kryvyi rih mile km front line eastern ukrain popul reput long citi europ"

Images released by state media showed Kim peering through the scope of a sniper rifle that KCNA said was going to be ""newly supplied to special operation units"". Other images showed him pointing to the bullseye of a target, crouching alongside heavily camouflaged soldiers, and smiling and waving to troops. Kim supervised ""automatic rifle firing drills and sniper rifle firing drills"" and, after personally test-firing the weapon, expressed ""great satisfaction over the performance and power of the sniper rifle developed in our own way"", KCNA said. Kim's visit to the special forces came on the same day that South Korea's Constitutional Court upheld president Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment over his disastrous martial law declaration, booting him from office and triggering fresh elections. NativeClick Ads Yoon had defended his December 3 attempt to subvert civilian rule as necessary to root out ""anti-state forces"" and what he claimed were threats from North Korea.

The “Hands Off” protest planners aimed to hold rallies in 1,200 locations, including in all 50 US states. Thousands of people turned out in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Washington DC, among other cities, on Saturday. Protesters cited grievances with Trump’s agenda ranging from social to economic issues. Coming days after Trump’s announcement that the US would impose import tariffs on most countries around the world, gatherings were also held outside the US, including in London, Paris and Berlin. In Boston, some protesters said they were motivated by immigration raids on US university students that have led to arrests and deportation proceedings. Law student Katie Smith said that she was motivated by Turkish international student Rumeysa Ozturk, whose arrest near Boston-area Tufts University by masked US agents was caught on camera last month. “You can stand up today or you can be taken later,” she said, adding: “I’m not usually a protest girlie.” In London, protesters held signs reading, “WTAF America?”, “Stop hurting people” and “He’s an idiot”. NativeClick Ads They chanted “hands off Canada”, “hands off Greenland” and “hands off Ukraine”, referencing Trump’s changes to US foreign policy. Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in annexing Canada and Greenland. He also got into a public dispute with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and has struggled to negotiate a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia. In Washington DC, thousands of protesters gathered to watch speeches by Democratic lawmakers. Many remarks focused on the role played in Trump’s administration by wealthy donors - most notably Elon Musk, who has served as an advisor to the president and spearheaded an effort to dramatically cut spending and the federal workforce. Florida Congressman Maxwell Frost denounced the “billionaire takeover of our government”. “When you steal from the people, expect the people to rise up. At the ballot box and in the streets,” he shouted. The protests come after a bruising week for the president and his allies. Republicans won a closely watched special Florida congressional election on Tuesday, but with slimmer margins than they had hoped. Wisconsin voters elected a Democratic judge to serve on the state supreme court, roundly rejecting a Musk-backed Republican candidate by almost 10 percentage points. In both states, Democrats sought to tap into voter anger towards the Trump administration’s policies and Elon Musk’s influence.","antitrump protest gather citi across u","thousand protest amass citi across u denounc presid donald trump large nationwid show opposit sinc presid take offic januari bbc new report hand protest planner aim hold ralli locat includ u state thousand peopl turn boston chicago lo angel new york washington dc among citi saturdai protest cite grievanc trump agendum ring social econom issu come dai trump announc u impos import tariff countri around world gather also hold outsid u includ london pari berlin boston protest say motiv immigr raid u univers student lead arrest deport proceed law student kati smith say motiv turkish intern student rumeysa ozturk whose arrest near bostonarea tuft univers mask u agent catch camera last month can stand todai can take late say ad i’m usual protest girli london protest hold sign read wtaf america stop hurt peopl he’ idiot nativeclick ad chant hand canada hand greenland hand ukrain referenc trump chang u foreign polici trump repeatedli express interest annex canada greenland also get public disput ukrainian presid volodymyr zelenski struggl negoti peac deal ukrain russia washington dc thousand protest gather watch speech democrat lawmak mani remark focus role plai trump administr wealthi donor notabl elon musk serv advisor presid spearhead effort dramat cut spend feder workforc florida congressman maxwel frost denounc billionair takeov governmentern steal peopl expect peopl rise ballot box street shout protest come bruis week presid alli republican win close watch special florida congression elect tuesdai slim margin hope wisconsin voter elect democrat judg serv state suprem court roundli reject muskback republican candid almost percentag point state democrat seek tap voter anger toward trump administration’ polici elon musk’ influenc"

The convoy of Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) ambulances, a UN car and a fire truck from Gaza’s Civil Defence came under fire near Rafah. Israel originally claimed troops opened fire because the convoy approached “suspiciously” in darkness without headlights or flashing lights. It said movement of the vehicles had not been previously co-ordinated or agreed with the army. Mobile phone footage, filmed by one of the paramedics who was killed, showed the vehicles did have lights on as they answered a call to help wounded people. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) insists at least six of the medics were linked to Hamas - but has so far provided no evidence. It admits they were unarmed when the soldiers opened fire. The mobile video, originally shared by the New York Times, shows the vehicles pulling up on the road when, without warning, shooting begins just before dawn. The footage continues for more than five minutes, with the paramedic, named as Refat Radwan, heard saying his last prayers before the voices of Israeli soldiers are heard approaching the vehicles.","israel admit mistak medic kill gaza","israel’ armi admit soldier make mistak kill emerg worker southern gaza march bbc report convoi palestinian red crescent societi prc ambul un car fire truck gaza’ civil defenc come fire near rafah israel origin claim troop open fire convoi approach suspici dark without headlight flash light say movement vehicl previous coordin agre armi mobil phone footag film on paramed kill show vehicl light answer call help wind peopl israel defens forc idf insist less six medic link hama far provid evid admit unarm soldier open fire mobil video origin share new york time show vehicl pull road without warn shoot begin just dawn footag continu five minut paramed name refat radwan hear sai last prayer voic isra soldier hear approach vehicl"

The foreign ministry said this in a statement on Monday. According to the statement, the Government of Bangladesh demands that Israel immediately cease all military operations, exercise maximum restraint, and abide by its duty under international humanitarian law. It said that Bangladesh strongly denounced the Israeli Occupying Forces’ indiscriminate aerial bombardment of densely populated civilian areas in Gaza with the overt intention of carrying out ethnic cleansing against the defenseless Palestinian population. Israel’s ongoing military attacks since last month's unilateral breach of the ceasefire have killed scores of Palestinians, mostly women and children as well as blocked the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza leading to a human catastrophe. Evidently, Israel has shown no regard to repeated international appeals and has instead engaged in an increasingly intense killing spree, said the foreign ministry. Bangladesh appealed to the international community, in particular the United Nations (UN) to discharge its moral and legal responsibilities by adopting immediate and effective steps towards the implementation of an unconditional ceasefire. Dhaka called for the cessation of all hostilities for the protection of lives of civilians and unobstructed passage of humanitarian relief to besieged Gaza. NativeClick Ads The foreign ministry reaffirmed the strong support of the Bangladesh Government for all the just rights of the Palestinian people, their right to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent and sovereign State of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. The Bangladesh government reiterated the necessity of returning to negotiation platform for permanent peace in the Middle East, which is vital for both regional and global stability. Bangladesh also appealed to all concerned to commit themselves to the path of diplomacy and dialogue to put an end to the violence and sufferings afflicting the Palestinian people. Bangladesh further remained steadfast and unequivocal in its call on the global community to work towards a two state solution of the Palestinian issue based on international law, United Nations resolutions, and the Palestinian aspirations for peace, dignity, and justice, said the statement.","bangladesh strongli condemn israel’ mass kill gaza","bangladesh express strong condemn isra occupi forc continu mass kill gross violat human right gaza strip foreign ministri say statement mondai accord statement govern bangladesh demand israel immedi ceas militari oper exercis maximum restraint abid duti intern humanitarian law say bangladesh strongli denounc isra occupi forc indiscrimin aerial bombard den popul civilian area gaza overt intent carri ethnic clean defenseless palestinian popul israel’ ongo militari attack sinc last month unilater breach ceasefir kill score palestinian mostli woman child good block entri humanitarian aid gaza lead human catastroph evid israel show regard repeat intern appeal instead engag increasingli intens kill spree say foreign ministri bangladesh appeal intern commun particular unit nation un discharg moral legal respons adopt immedi effect step toward implement uncondit ceasefir dhaka call cessat hostil protect live civilian unobstruct passag humanitarian relief besieg gaza nativeclick ad foreign ministri reaffirm strong support bangladesh govern just right palestinian peopl right selfdetermin establish independ sovereign state palestin base pre border east jerusalem capit bangladesh governmentern reiter necess return negoti platform perman peac middl east vital region global stabil bangladesh also appeal concern commit path diplomaci dialogu put end violenc suffer afflict palestinian peopl bangladesh remain steadfast unequivoc call global commun work toward two state solut palestinian issu base intern law unit nation resolut palestinian aspir peac digniti justic say statement"

Fisheries and Livestock Adviser Farida Akhtar made this announcement at a press conference at the ministry's conference room on Monday afternoon. She said conserving jatka would boost hilsa production, helping to stabilize prices and ensure better market supply. The advisor mentioned that the interim government has implemented an effective action plan to make Hilsa affordable for common people and as part of this effort, Jatka Conservation Week will be observed during April 8 to 14. The theme for this year's event is “If Jatka Fishing is Stopped Hilsa will be Caught in Nets.” Jatka refers to a small Hilsa fish, measuring around 10 inches or 25 centimeters. A hilsa weighing one kilogram typically measures between 40 and 50 centimeters, and if it weighs more than 2 kilograms, it reaches about 60 to 62 centimeters. Through the Jatka Conservation Week, Jatka will be allowed to grow into a mature hilsa. During the 2023-24 fiscal year, the country produced 5,29,000 metric tons of Hilsa, contributing roughly 11 percent of the nation's total fish production. Hilsa also plays a significant role in the national economy, contributing over 1 percent to the GDP. Bangladesh is the world's leading producer of Hilsa, accounting for over 80 percent of global production, harvested from the country's rivers, estuaries, and seas. It ranks the first among the 11 Hilsa-producing countries. NativeClick Ads The Fisheries Adviser highlighted that the government not only enforces laws to protect Jatka but also significantly increased the amount of VGF (Vulnerable Group Feeding) food assistance for fishermen during the ban of hilsa fishing. In the 2023-24 fiscal year, 361,071 fishing families who stopped fishing Jatka were provided with 28,885 metric tons of VGF rice, distributed at a rate of 40 kg per month for four months. To protect mother Hilsa during its main breeding season, 13,707 metric tons of VGF rice were distributed to 566,565 fishing families, at a rate of 25 kg each, during the same fiscal year. Besides food aid, various types of assistance, including the provision of calf calves, are being offered to fishermen through the ""Hilsa Resource Development and Management Project"" to create alternative employment opportunities. The Fisheries Adviser urged everyone to cooperate in protecting Jatka. Jatka Conservation Week 2025 will be observed in 20 Hilsa-rich districts across the country, including Dhaka, Manikganj, Rajbari, Shariatpur, Madaripur, Faridpur, Munshiganj, Barisal, Bhola, Patuakhali, Pirojpur, Barguna, Jhalakati, Chandpur, Lakshmipur, Feni, Noakhali, Chattogram, Bagerhat, and Sirajganj.","jatka conserv week april","governmentern will observ jatka conserv week start april aim protect boost jatka young hilsa product fisheri livestock advis farida akhtar make announc press confer ministri confer room mondai afternoon say conserv jatka boost hilsa product help stabil price ensur good market suppli advisor mention interim governmentern implement effect action plan make hilsa afford common peopl part effort jatka conserv week will observ april theme year event jatka fish stop hilsa will catch net jatka refer small hilsa fish measur around inch centimet hilsa weigh on kilogram typic measur centimet weigh kilogram reach centimet jatka conserv week jatka will allow grow matur hilsa fiscal year countri produc metric ton hilsa contribut roughli percent nation total fish product hilsa also plai signific role nation economi contribut percent gdp bangladesh world lead produc hilsa account percent global product harvest countri river estuari sea rank first among hilsaproduc countri nativeclick ad fisheri advis highlight governmentern enforc law protect jatka also significantli increas amount vgf vulner group fee food assist fisherman ban hilsa fish fiscal year fish famili stop fish jatka provid metric ton vgf rice distribut rate kg per month four month protect mother hilsa main breed season metric ton vgf rice distribut fish famili rate kg fiscal year besid food aid variou type assist includ provis calf calv offer fisherman hilsa resourc develop manag project creat altern employ opportun fisheri advis urg everyon cooper protect jatka jatka conserv week will observ hilsarich district across countri includ dhaka manikganj rajbari shariatpur madaripur faridpur munshiganj baris bhola patuakhali pirojpur barguna jhalakati chandpur lakshmipur feni noakhali chattogram bagerhat sirajganj"

Furthermore, the letter said Bangladesh was planning a long-term LNG deal with the US and would provide private equity access to healthcare to get tariff relief. “Our government is examining ways to reduce tariff rates and eliminate all kinds of non-tariff barriers and has initiated reforms to enhance mutually beneficial trade for both countries. The reform initiative includes import policy order, simplification of customs procedure, enforcement of intellectual property rights, protect trademarks, patent rights and so on,” reads the letter.

Beijing retaliated on Sunday, following last week's decision by Trump to slap a 34% tax on Chinese imports as part of his ""Liberation Day"" that set a minimum 10% levy on nearly all of America's trading partners. In a social media post on Monday, Trump gave China until Tuesday to scrap its countermeasure or face the 50% tax. In response, the Chinese embassy in the US accused Washington of ""economic bullying"", and said that Beijing ""will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests"". If Trump acts on his threat, US companies could face a total rate of 104% on Chinese imports- as it comes on top of 20% tariffs already put in place in March and the 34% announced last week. There are fears that this could deepen a trade war between the world's two biggest economies and global rivals. In his post on Truth Social, Trump also warned that ""all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us [on tariffs] will be terminated!"" Also on Monday, the US president said he was not considering a pause on the global import tariffs to allow for negotiations with other countries. NativeClick Ads ""We're not looking at that. We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and there are going to be fair deals,"" he said. Trump said China had introduced its countermeasure ""despite my warning that any country that Retaliates against the U.S. by issuing additional Tariffs... will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs"". Beijing shot back, saying that ""pressuring or threatening China is not a right way to engage"". ""The US hegemonic move in the name of 'reciprocity' serves its selfish interests at the expense of other countries' legitimate interests and puts 'America first' over international rules,"" Chinese embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu said in a statement. ""This is a typical move of unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying."" Speaking from the White House, the US president said there could be both permanent tariffs and negotiations. ""We have $36tn (£28tn) debt for a reason,"" he said, adding that the US would be talking to China among other countries to make a ""fair deal and a good deal"". ""It's now America first,"" Trump said. The tariffs would come as a major blow to China's manufacturers, for whom the US is a key market for exports. China's top exports to the US include electrical products and other machinery, computers, furniture, toys, vehicles and equipment. The US's top exports to China are oilseeds and grains, as well aircraft, machinery and pharmaceuticals. Uncertainty around the tariffs led to a turbulent day on global stock markets. Markets worldwide have plunged since Trump announced the global tariffs. The value of US stock markets dropped sharply again on opening on Monday, while Europe's biggest markets, including London's FTSE 100, closed more than 4% down. Asian share indexes had nosedived on Monday, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index falling by more than 13%, its biggest one-day fall since 1997. However, most showed a slight correction on Tuesday with most bourses opening higher. The impact on the FTSE 100, America's S&P 500, Germany's Dax and Japan's Nikkei has been wide-ranging._Agencies.","trump threaten new tariff china","donald trump threaten china extra tariff good import u withdraw countertariff global market continu fall report bbc beij retali sundai follow last week decis trump slap tax chine import part liber dai set minimum levi nearli america trade partner social medium post mondai trump give china tuesdai scrap countermeasur face tax respons chine embassi u accus washington econom bulli say beij will firmli safeguard legitim right interest trump act threat u compani face total rate chine import come top tariff alreadi put place march announc last week fear deepen trade war world two big economi global rival post truth social trump also warn talk china concern request meet u tariff will termin also mondai u presid say consid paus global import tariff allow negoti countri nativeclick ad look mani mani countri come negoti deal u go fair deal say trump say china introduc countermeasur despit warn countri retali u issu addit tariff will immedi meet new substanti high tariff beij shoot back sai pressur threaten china right wai engag u hegemon move name areciproc serv selfish interest expens countri legitim interest put america first intern rule chine embassi spokesman liu pengyu say statement typic move unilater protection econom bulli speak white hous u presid say perman tariff negoti tn tn debt reason say ad u talk china among countri make fair deal good deal now america first trump say tariff come major blow china manufactur u kei market export china top export u includ electr product machineri comput furnitur toi vehicl equip u top export china oilse grain good aircraft machineri pharmaceut uncertainti around tariff lead turbul dai global stock market market worldwid plung sinc trump announc global tariff valu u stock market drop sharpli open mondai europ big market includ london ftse close asian share index nosediv mondai hong kong hang seng index fall big onedai fall sinc howev show slight correct tuesdai bours open high impact ftse america sp germani dax japan nikkei widerangingag"

The attack was conducted by an Israeli drone which targeted a motorcycle repair shop in the border town of Taybeh, with Israel claiming to have struck “a commander in Hezbollah’s artillery system.” A Lebanese security source said the attack targeted “a motorcycle as its rider stopped in front of a motorcycle repair shop on the Taybeh-Adaisseh road, resulting in his death and a fire breaking out at the location.” Hezbollah later identified the deceased man as Mohammed Adnan Mansour. Under the terms of the ceasefire agreement, Hezbollah was meant to withdraw fighters from south of the Litani River and dismantle any remaining military infrastructure there. Israel was to withdraw all its forces from southern Lebanon but continues to hold five positions that it deems “strategic.” Lebanon’s President Joseph Aoun has urged Washington to pressure Israel to withdraw from the five border points, saying the ongoing troop presence “complicates the situation.” On Monday, the Lebanese government received a message from the US confirming the need to disarm Hezbollah and implement necessary reforms for the country to receive financial aid, with Washington anticipating swift action on these issues. NativeClick Ads A delegation from the American Task Force on Lebanon, headed by Edward Gabriel, conveyed the message to Aoun. Aoun said there is no place for any weapons or armed groups outside the framework of the Lebanese state. Aoun on Monday said the issue needed to be resolved “through communication and dialogue because, in the end, Hezbollah is a Lebanese component.” Authorities would soon begin drafting a “national security strategy,” he added. During a meeting with the delegation, Aoun reaffirmed Lebanon’s full commitment to UN Resolution 1701, commending the work of UNIFIL south of the Litani River. Aoun pointed to “Israeli violations of the ceasefire agreement,” saying that “Israel’s continued presence in the five hills it occupied will not be beneficial for Lebanon and will further complicate the situation. “Therefore, we call on the US to pressure Israel to withdraw from them,” he added. “The Lebanese Army, north of the Litani River, dismantled six camps that were under the control of Palestinian groups outside the refugee camps,” Aoun continued. “They are now empty, and the weapons found were either confiscated or destroyed.” Aoun confirmed that “the priority is to reduce tension in the south.” He added: “The will is there, and the UNIFIL are doing their job to the fullest. But we must take into account that they are bearing many responsibilities. Lebanon needs time to resolve matters calmly.” Aoun noted that “three weeks ago, the government approved the recruitment of 4,500 soldiers to boost our preparedness in the south.” He emphasized to the American delegation that “reforms and the disarmament of weapons are demands from Lebanon, as well as from the international community and the US. We are committed to working towards these goals, and building trust is a step we have already initiated.” Gabriel spoke about the “significant recognition of the efforts made by the Lebanese Army and the commendable work of the president.” He stated: “I understand that your contribution to this was extremely important, and there are still many tasks that need to be completed, which we have been made aware of. The sooner these are carried out, the quicker we can assist you.” Gabriel revealed that “a funding bill is being prepared in Congress for the upcoming year, along with three significant pieces of legislation included in the economic package.” Aoun also met on Monday with Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri to discuss the outcomes of the visit of US Deputy Envoy to the Middle East Morgan Ortagus to Lebanon last weekend. According to a political observer, the emphasis was placed on “expediting the approval of reform laws in parliament” after “constructive and positive” discussions with Ortagus.

The average temperature in March in Europe climbed to above 6 degrees Celsius (42.8 Fahrenheit), which is 0.26C (0.468F) above the previous hottest March in 2014. The average global temperature last month was 1.6C (2.88F) higher than in pre-industrial times, the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said on Tuesday. The findings, contained in C3S’s monthly report, underscore growing concerns that the international goal of limiting global warming by the year 2100 to 1.5C (2.7F) above pre-industrial levels is slipping out of reach. Scientists have warned that every fraction of a degree of global warming increases the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, heavy rainfall and droughts. Samantha Burgess, strategic lead at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, which runs the C3S service, noted that Europe experienced extremes in both heavy rain and drought in March. Europe last month recorded “many areas experiencing their driest March on record and others their wettest March on record for at least the past 47 years”, Burgess said. Scientists said climate change also intensified an extreme heatwave across Central Asia and fuelled conditions for extreme rainfall in countries like Argentina. NativeClick Ads Arctic sea ice also fell to its lowest monthly extent last month for any March in the 47-year record of satellite data, C3S said. The previous three months also set record lows.

"science-technology","https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111555","Tariffs on China set to rise to at least 104%: Trump","09/04/2025","US President Donald Trump is set to impose an astounding 104% in levies across all Chinese imports on Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced on Tuesday. This comes on top of Chinese tariffs that were in place prior to Trump’s second term, reports CNN. China was already set to see tariffs increase by 34% on Wednesday as part of Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs package. But the president tacked on another 50% after Beijing didn’t back off on its promise to impose 34% retaliatory tariffs on US goods by noon Tuesday, adding an additional 84% in duties. Earlier Tuesday, China’s Commerce Ministry said it “firmly opposes” the additional 50% tariffs on Chinese imports, calling it “a mistake upon a mistake.” The ministry vowed to escalate its retaliation on US exports. US stocks, which soared Tuesday morning, began moving lower following Leavitt’s comments. Markets ultimately ended the day markedly lower. The Dow fell 320 points, or 0.84%. The broader S&P 500 fell 1.57%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 2.15%. “Countries like China, who have chosen to retaliate and try to double down on their mistreatment of American workers, are making a mistake,” Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday. “President Trump has a spine of steel, and he will not break.” “The Chinese want to make a deal, they just don’t know how to do it,” she added. She declined to share what, if any, terms Trump would consider to lower tariffs on China. Asian markets largely tracked Wall Street’s losses, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 opening about 3% lower on Wednesday. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng also fell 3%. South Korea’s Kopsi and Australia’s benchmark ASX 200 index were each down about 1%. Along with increasing China’s overall tariff rate, President Trump also signed an executive order Tuesday night tripling tariffs on goods worth less than $800 from the country. As it stands, packages under $800 have been exempt from tariffs through the so-called “de minimus” exemption. NativeClick Ads Initially, those goods were set to face tariffs of 30% come May 2. But Trump’s latest executive order hiked the rates to 90%. This will impact Americans who order from sites like Shein, Temu and AliExpress, likely leading to higher prices of the goods. In February, Trump had initially imposed a 10% tariff on all Chinese goods, with no exceptions, tying it to the country’s alleged role in aiding illegal immigration and getting fentanyl into the US. Last month, he doubled those rates. China was America’s second largest source of imports last year, shipping a total of $439 billion worth of goods to the US, while the US exported $144 billion worth of goods to China. The mutual tariffs threaten to hurt domestic industries and are poised to result in layoffs. When Trump’s first term ended, the US charged an average tariff rate of 19.3% on Chinese goods, according to a Peterson Institute for International Economic analysis. The Biden administration kept most of Trump’s tariffs in place while also adding additional ones, bringing the average rate to 20.8%. Come Wednesday, the total average tariff on Chinese exports to the US will soar to nearly 125%._Agencies.","tariff china set rise less trump","u presid donald trump set impos astound levi across chine import wednesdai white hous press secretari karolin leavitt announc tuesdai come top chine tariff place prior trump 2 term report cnn china alreadi set see tariff increas wednesdai part trump reciproc tariff packag presid tack anoth beij didn’t back promis impos retaliatori tariff u good noon tuesdai ad addit duti early tuesdai china’ commerc ministri say firmli oppos addit tariff chine import call mistak upon mistak ministri vow escal retali u export u stock soar tuesdai morn begin move low follow leavitt’ comment market ultim end dai markedli low dow fall point broad sp fall techheavi nasdaq composit slide countri like china choose retali try doubl mistreat american worker make mistak leavitt tell report tuesdai presid trump spine steel will break chine want make deal just don’t know ad declin share term trump consid low tariff china asian market larg track wall street’ loss japan’ nikkei open low wednesdai hong kong’ hang seng also fall south korea’ kopsi australia’ benchmark asx index along increas china’ overal tariff rate presid trump also sign execut order tuesdai night tripl tariff good worth little countri stand packag exempt tariff socal de minimu exempt nativeclick ad initi good set face tariff come mai trump late execut order hike rate will impact american order site like shein temu aliexpress like lead high price good februari trump initi impos tariff chine good except ty country’ alleg role aid illeg immigr get fentanyl u last month doubl rate china america’ 2 large sourc import last year ship total billion worth good u u export billion worth good china mutual tariff threaten hurt domest industri poi result layoff trump first term end u charg averag tariff rate chine good accord peterson institut intern econom analysi biden administr keep trump tariff place also ad addit on bring averag rate come wednesdai total averag tariff chine export u will soar nearli agenc"

Now, there will be no scope to export Bangladeshi products to Nepal and Bhutan through the land route. The Indian Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) issued a circular on Tuesday, officially withdrawing the transshipment facility. At the same time, it repealed its previous order dated 29 June 2020, which had enabled the transshipment. According to information available on the CBIC’s official website, the 2020 order permitted Bangladeshi exports to third countries to transit through Indian customs stations and exit via other ports or airports within India. This arrangement, known as transshipment, enabled Bangladeshi cargo to reach Nepal and Bhutan by passing through Indian land routes and switching transport vehicles at designated customs points. The new order stipulates that the facility is no longer valid. However, goods that are already in transit within Indian territory under the previous arrangement will be allowed to exit the country without hindrance. Under the transshipment process, Bangladeshi goods destined for Nepal and Bhutan travel through Indian land routes, where the cargo is transferred from one vehicle to another at the border and Indian customs checkpoints.

Mr. Trump's broad-based tariffs, which apply to imports of almost every nation, kicked in after midnight Eastern time in the U.S. The two countries have been involved in a game of tit-for-tat on trade, with Beijing standing firmly against each new tariff introduced by Washington. “The US escalation of tariffs on China is a mistake upon mistake, severely infringing upon China’s legitimate rights and interests, and seriously damaging the multilateral trading system based on rules,” China’s State Council Tariff Commission said in a statement announcing the fresh levy. The amped-up retaliation comes after China repeatedly warned that it would “fight to the end” if the US moved forward with further tariffs. On Wednesday, Trump’s additional levies on Chinese imports had originally been set to increase by 34 percentage points. But the president tacked on another 50 percentage points after Beijing refused to back down from the standoff. Prior to the most recent rounds of escalation, Trump had already imposed 20% levies on China.

He came up with the importance during a meeting with Baroness Rosie Winterton, the UK Trade Envoy to Bangladesh, at the State Guest House Jamuna on Wednesday. During the meeting, they reiterated their commitment to deepening bilateral ties, with Baroness Winterton acknowledging the ‘long and trusted history’ between the two nations. “We have a long history together, and we are pleased to see the direction of reforms being undertaken,” she said. Prof Yunus remarked that the country is passing through a transformative moment. “It’s a very critical time for us. We are focused on rebuilding institutions and reshaping priorities,” he said. Highlighting Bangladesh’s pressing need for a skilled healthcare workforce, Prof Yunus said, “We currently have a shortage of nurses. But nursing is not just a national concern—it’s a global necessity. We want to train more nurses not only for Bangladesh but also for the world.” The Chief Adviser invited UK support to strengthen Bangladesh’s under-resourced health sector. “Government-run health programmes are nearly non-functional,” he noted.

We urge you to support global access to vaccines by advocating for lifting patent protections so that every country can produce them affordably under a social business model,” the Chief Adviser said.

They even derided a report on Tuesday that said the president was considering a 90-day pause – news that triggered a brief stock market surge, reports BBC today (April 10). But now that pause on higher tariff rates, with a few notable exceptions, is a reality. The reordering of the global economic order is on hold, and Trump's promise of a golden age of American manufacturing will have to wait. The White House has said that going big on tariffs and then hitting the pause button, before entering negotiations with individual countries, was the plan all along. ""We've had more than 75 countries contact us, and I imagine, after today, there will be more,"" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters shortly after the announcement. That framing from the White House is not surprising, of course. And it is difficult to ignore the investor panic, tumbling bond market and growing chorus of Republican criticism and public disapproval that preceded the announcement. So was it a strategic retreat in the face of unexpected resistance, or yet another example of Trump's ""art of the deal"" negotiating strategy at work?","trump step back cliff edg allout global trade war","dai donald trump white hous team insist fulli commit decis impos sweep reciproc tariff dozen countri even derid report tuesdai say presid consid dai paus new trigger brief stock market surg report bbc todai april now paus high tariff rate notabl except realiti reorder global econom order hold trump promis golden ag american manufactur will wait white hous say go big tariff hit paus button enter negoti individu countri plan along countri contact u imagin todai will treasuri secretari scott bessent tell report shortli announc frame white hous surpris cours difficult ignor investor panic tumbl bond market grow choru republican critic public disapprov preced announc strateg retreat face unexpect resist yet anoth exampl trump art deal negoti strategi work"

The Israeli military said the raid targeted a senior Hamas fighter, but did not give his name, claiming that it had taken several steps to reduce harm to civilians. Ayub Salim, 26, a resident of Shujayea, told Al Jazeera that some victims were “torn to pieces” by the attack with “multiple missiles” that sent shrapnel flying. “Dust and massive destruction filled the entire place. We couldn’t see anything, just [heard] the screams and panic of the people,” he said. Reporting from Shujayea, Al Jazeera’s Ibrahim Al Khalili said civil defence forces and local residents had come together to pull trapped civilians from under the rubble. Most of the victims had come to live in the block after being “forcibly displaced”, he said. Israel resumed its aerial bombardment of Gaza on March 18 after a nearly-two-month truce with Hamas, and later expanded its ground assault across the territory.

"science-technology","https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111593","Trump imposes 145% tariff on China goods ","10/04/2025","U.S. stocks tumbled on Thursday as investors assessed the worsening trade war with China, and President Trump clarified that he had raised tariffs on Chinese goods by a total of 145 percent since taking office. On Wednesday, the president said he was increasing the import tax on China to 125 percent, even as he postponed similar punishing levies on most other countries for three months. He also left in place new tariffs on automobiles, steel and aluminum. But on Thursday the White House put out a statement making it clear the 125 percent rise was in addition to a 20 percent tariff Mr. Trump had already imposed on China for its role in supplying fentanyl and its precursors in the United States. While tensions between Beijing and Washington showed no signs of easing, the European Union responded to Mr. Trump’s decision to put off implementing a hefty import tax on its goods by announcing it would also delay its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports for 90 days. After Mr. Trump announced the tariff pause, the S&P 500 posted its biggest daily gain since 2008. By midday Thursday, the index has dropped around 4 percent, a decline that deepened in the hour after the White House clarified the tariff on China was steeper than initially expected. The three-month delay on most country-specific tariffs, which Mr. Trump’s says are aimed at reversing bilateral trade deficits, did not temper the concerns of many economists who cautioned that the full repercussions from the trade war between Washington and Beijing would not be felt for weeks. A report released on Thursday showed that U.S. inflation eased more than expected in March, providing what economists say is likely to be only a temporary reprieve before Mr. Trump’s tariffs are expected to reignite price pressures.

Under the 1944 treaty, Mexico must send 1.75 million acre-feet of water to the U.S. from the Rio Grande through a network of interconnected dams and reservoirs every five years. An acre-foot of water is enough to fill about half an Olympic-sized swimming pool, reports reuters. The current five-year cycle is up in October, but Mexico has sent less than 30% of the required water, according to data from the International Boundary and Water Commission. ""Mexico OWES Texas 1.3 million acre-feet of water under the 1944 Water Treaty, but Mexico is unfortunately violating their Treaty obligation,"" Trump posted on Truth Social. ""My Agriculture Secretary, Brooke Rollins, is standing up for Texas Farmers, and we will keep escalating consequences, including TARIFFS and, maybe even SANCTIONS, until Mexico honors the Treaty, and GIVES TEXAS THE WATER THEY ARE OWED!"" Trump said. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, in response, said on X that Mexico has been complying with the treaty ""to the extent water is available"" amid three years of drought. Mexico sent a proposal to U.S. officials on Wednesday, Sheinbaum said, to address the water supply to Texas, which includes short-term actions.

"science-technology","https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111608","Discontent grows around UN climate conference, required solution for planet","11/04/2025","Some experts already have noted that the United Nation's climate conferences are failing to effectively address global climate change. Concerns have intensified due to the lack of a resolution regarding the climate fund at the COP29 conference in Baku. Poorer countries expressed dissatisfaction with this commitment, Environmentalists are starting to lose confidence in the United Nations Climate Change Conference. Environmentalists have commented that these conferences have failed to exert effective pressure on global leaders to protect the climate. Particularly at COP29, disappointment and frustration have arisen following the decision on new financing decision. Therefore, they are demanding accelerated aid and specific commitments regarding carbon credits and climate compensation at the upcoming conference (COP30). Environmentalists believe the UN should take a more robust role in this regard. In the future world, the impacts of climate change have emerged as the biggest challenge. It is not just the problem of a single nation or a specific region, but rather a global issue. Therefore, to address the challenges posed by climate change, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has been held annually since 1995. At the 29th United Nations Climate Conference in Baku, Azerbaijan, the focus was primarily on financing. Before the conference even began, there were controversies, doubts, and concerns. From November 11, representatives from 200 countries, totaling 85,000 individuals, engaged in discussions about funding, finance, adaptation, and promised commitments. The presence of large delegations from oil-producing countries and multinational corporations cast a shadow of skepticism and debate over the entire conference. Throughout the two-week event, various sessions sparked extensive discussions on these issues. On the final day, prolonged talks ensued due to a lack of consensus. Wealthy nations, including the European Union and the United States, agreed to provide $300 billion annually to climate funds by 2035, following extended discussions at Azerbaijan's COP-29 conference. However, while there was agreement on a deal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, critics and developing nations labeled the financial assistance as inadequate. Additionally, environmentalists expressed skepticism about how effective the agreement would be. This year, developing countries, including Bangladesh, sought $1.3 trillion annually to address the damages caused by climate change. High carbon dioxide emissions are a significant contributor to climate change, with 80% of these emissions attributed to developed countries. Consequently, calls for compensation for affected nations emerged from the Paris Climate Conference. Although there was some agreement on fund creation, there was little urgency regarding financing. To combat climate risks, the G7 coalition of affected countries, including Bangladesh, is demanding $500 trillion in grants from carbon-emitting nations. They have set a target for this new funding annually until 2030. However, during the COP-29 conference, developed and affected nations did not reach consensus on this matter. By 2024, global temperatures are projected to rise by at least 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels. The world is currently experiencing its hottest decade. The goal was to keep the increase in global temperatures below 1.5 degrees Celsius. Carbon-emitting countries are expected to contribute $10 billion annually to the UN Green Fund for addressing the climate crisis, yet temperatures have risen by 0.8 degrees Celsius instead of decreasing. Environmental activists believe that despite ongoing discussions at COP conferences, real change is taking too long. Many countries face accusations of not taking sufficient action against climate change, particularly developed nations, which are often deemed most responsible and yet fail to take adequate measures. Additionally, countries affected by climate change are claiming compensation, but developed nations are reluctant to assist. Environmentalists are also frustrated by the continued use of fossil fuels and the lack of investment in renewable energy sources. As a result, activists are advocating for alternative climate change conferences, arguing that traditional conferences are heavily influenced by large countries and corporate interests. In contrast, alternative conferences are said to prioritize the opinions of local communities, environmental organizations, and people from various backgrounds. While conventional conferences emphasize new ideas, technologies, and solutions, discussions often get mired in political disputes. In alternative conferences, there is a greater focus on solutions, and activists also wish to discuss the local impacts of climate change and potential remedies. NativeClick Ads Their demands include taking rapid and effective action against climate change, enforcing stricter targets for carbon emissions, providing adequate compensation to countries affected by climate change, increasing investment in renewable energy sources while phasing out fossil fuel use, and urging world leaders to adopt a stronger and clearer stance on climate change. Additionally, through alternative conferences, they seek to ensure compensation for countries harmed by the actions of developed nations, reduce fossil fuel consumption, explore new energy sources, change food production and distribution systems in the context of climate change, and find solutions by utilizing the knowledge and experience of local communities. In fact, such alternative climate conferences can play a crucial role in the fight against climate change, steering the world towards more practical and effective solutions. Anti-COP or alternative climate conferences are typically held alongside COP conferences, although they have sometimes taken place in separate locations. The first alternative climate conference began in 2009 in Copenhagen, surrounding the COP-15 conference. At that time, climate activists opposed the structure of the main conference, raising claims against protests, unnecessary discussions, and corporate interests. Following this, protests and the scope of alternative climate conferences expanded during COP-16 (2010, Cancun) and COP-17 (2011, Doha). Subsequently, environmentalists and climate activists began participating en masse in these alternative conferences. To understand why there are protests surrounding climate conferences, it is essential to first grasp the main topics of these conferences and the positions of various parties involved. Environmentalists protest in Baku, Azerbaijan, demanding that rich countries pay more to help poor countries combat the effects of climate change. Photo: Collected Evaluating Previous COP Conferences: The first COP1 conference took place in Berlin, Germany, from March 2 to April 7, 1995. This conference made decisions regarding joint efforts to combat global climate change. The UN Climate Change COP21 conference was held in Paris, France, in 2015. Based on the opinions of 196 countries, the Paris Agreement was recommended at this conference. The agreement determined to limit global warming to within 1.5 degrees Celsius. It was deemed reasonable to keep global warming within this limit to address droughts, irregular rainfall, salinity, and natural disasters worldwide. It was also stated that greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced by approximately 43% by 2030. Therefore, the Paris Agreement was a binding and groundbreaking climate change treaty, opening discussions on how to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. At the COP26 conference, the allocation of funds for building resilience against climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions was widely discussed. The issue of developed countries providing $100 billion annually to developing nations to combat climate change was addressed. The conversation also included visible plans to prevent greenhouse gas emissions and what further action plans could be added for the future. As a result, it is possible to keep global warming within the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit mentioned in the Paris Agreement. Among the key topics discussed at COP27 was the specific allocation of funds each year to help developing countries recover from climate-related disasters. The conference emphasized a strong demand to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 43% by 2030. The need for transparency and accountability from businesses in tackling climate change was also highlighted. There was a call for companies to develop concrete plans within the following year on how they would address climate change. Additionally, discussions were held regarding the Green Climate Fund, which proposed allocations of $211.68 million for developed countries and $70.6 million for least developed countries. Furthermore, the establishment of a special fund of $35 million for climate change was welcomed. Consideration of a new climate change fund by 2024, based on the needs and priorities of developing countries, was also ongoing. Ultimately, the UN's permanent committee was tasked with preparing a report on doubling the climate change fund by 2024. At COP28, nearly 200 countries agreed to gradually phase out the use of fossil fuels. Representatives from these countries committed to gradually halting the use of oil, gas, and coal to avoid the adverse effects of climate change, which climate experts view as a ""historic"" agreement in the past 30 years. However, there remains skepticism about what countries like Bangladesh and others affected by climate change will gain from this agreement. The cessation of fossil fuel use was prioritized at the conference. Meanwhile, the global temperature has started to rise due to the inability to reduce fossil fuel use. Yet, no government has ever reached a consensus on when or how this reduction will take place. At the latest COP29 conference, discussions focused on alternative allocations, raising concerns that previous initiatives may have fallen short. Some environmental activists have indicated that there may not be significant demands from developing countries at the upcoming COP30 conference this year. Expert Opinion: Dr. Mohammad Shamsuddoha, the CEO of Center for Participatory Research and Development (CPRD), stated that the coalition of affected countries, G7, has demanded $500 billion in grants from carbon-emitting nations to address climate risks. However, at the COP29 conference, developed and affected countries could not reach an agreement on this issue because developed countries seek guarantees on their investments in climate change. For example, if a developed country lends Bangladesh $100 to mitigate climate risks, it requires assurance that Bangladesh can repay this amount, with interest, after a specified time. Without such guarantees, the loan remains uncertain. He noted that during the latest conference, many poor nations affected by climate change expressed anger at the indecisiveness of wealthy countries. These disaster-stricken countries labeled the promised funds from wealthy nations, responsible for global pollution, as ""insultingly trivial."" He believes that organizing alternative conferences may not provide a good solution. Instead, it would be better to make the annual UN events (COP) more effective. Arifur Rahman, a Bangladeshi journalist working on climate change, stated, ""Climate change is one of the greatest environmental challenges faced by societies today. It has significant implications for energy, food, and water security, as well as health and safety for countries and people around the world."" However, he noted that the issues of impact and compensation for poor countries are not receiving adequate attention at COP conferences. It is crucial for these countries to send more representatives and present data on their losses to portray the real picture. The UN should also apply pressure on wealthy nations to ensure that affected countries can benefit. The EU representative Wopke Hoekstra, welcomed the new $300 billion climate agreement, stating that the COP29 conference will be remembered as the beginning of a new era in climate financing. Conversely, Mohamed Adow, director of the research organization Power Shift Africa, criticized the agreement, stating, ""This COP is a disaster for the developing world. The wealthy countries that claim to take climate change seriously have betrayed the planet and its inhabitants.""

No new humanitarian supplies have entered the Palestinian enclave since Israel blocked the entry of aid trucks on March 2, as talks stalled on the next stage of a now broken truce. Israel resumed its military assault on March 18. Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said 25,000 aid trucks had entered Gaza in the 42 days of the ceasefire and that Hamas had used the aid to rebuild its war machine, an allegation which the group has denied. Spoljaric said supplies were running critically low. “For six weeks, nothing has come in, so we will, in a couple of weeks’ time, run out of supplies that we need to keep the hospital going,” she said. The World Health Organization said supplies of antibiotics and blood bags were dwindling fast. Twenty-two out of 36 hospitals in the enclave are only minimally functional, Dr. Rik Peeperkorn told reporters in Geneva via video link in Jerusalem. The Red Cross president also raised concern about the safety of humanitarian operations. NativeClick Ads “It is extremely dangerous for the population to move, but it’s especially also dangerous for us to operate,” Spoljaric said. In March, the bodies of 15 emergency and aid workers, including eight members of the Palestinian Red Crescent, were found buried in a mass grave in southern Gaza. The U.N. and Red Crescent accused Israeli forces of killing them. The Israeli military said on Monday that an initial investigation showed that the incident occurred “due to a sense of threat” after it said it had identified six Hamas militants in the vicinity. Spoljaric called for an immediate ceasefire in order to release the remaining hostages held by Hamas and to address grave humanitarian issues in Gaza. Israel began its military campaign in Gaza in October 2023 after Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people and took some 250 hostages on a raid into Israel, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, more than 50,800 Palestinians have been killed and much of the territory has been reduced to rubble.","gaza hell earth red cross","presid red cross describ humanitarian situat gaza fridai hell earth warn field hospit will run suppli within two week reuter report now find situat describ hell earth peopl don’t access water electr food mani part mirjana spoljar say headquart intern committe red cross geneva new humanitarian suppli enter palestinian enclav sinc israel block entri aid truck march talk stall next stage now break truce israel resum militari assault march israel’ ministri foreign affair say aid truck enter gaza dai ceasefir hama us aid rebuild war machin alleg group deni spoljar say suppli run critic low six week noth come will coupl week time run suppli need keep hospit go say world health organ say suppli antibiot blood bag dwindl fast twentytwo hospit enclav minim function dr rik peeperkorn tell report geneva via video link jerusalem red cross presid also rais concern safeti humanitarian oper nativeclick ad extrem danger popul move it’ especi also danger u oper spoljar say march bodi emerg aid worker includ eight member palestinian red crescent find buri mass grave southern gaza un red crescent accus isra forc kill isra militari say mondai initi investig show incid occur due sens threat say identifi six hama milit vicin spoljar call immedi ceasefir order releas remain hostag hold hama address grave humanitarian issu gaza israel begin militari campaign gaza octob hamasl milit kill peopl take hostag raid israel accord isra talli sinc palestinian kill much territori reduc rubbl"

Michael LaSalle, the assistant chief of the Boca Raton Fire Department, confirmed that all three on board were killed in the crash. Meanwhile, another person was hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries after possibly driving through the fireball from the crash. The FAA said it and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) are investigating the circumstances surrounding the crash. In a statement released after the crash, Boca Raton Mayor Scott Singer expressed deep sorrow over the loss of life, offered condolences to the victims’ families, and praised the swift response of first responders and partnering agencies. “Our hearts are heavy today with this tragic loss of life.

The spokesperson indicated that the attacks were carried out in support of the Palestinian people. “We affirm that confronting the ongoing American aggression against our country will not prevent us from continuing to fulfill our duty towards Gaza,” Sarea added. Israel’s Channel 12 News reported that a Yemeni drone was intercepted near the Dead Sea within the Jordanian airspace before it could reach Israel. The Jordanian army confirmed later on Friday evening that an unidentified drone entered Jordanian airspace and crashed in the Ma’in area of Madaba governorate, near the Dead Sea, and no casualties were reported. Even since Israel renewed its intensive strikes in March across the Gaza Strip, the Houthis have been launching frequent attacks against Israeli and U.S. targets. Earlier in the day, the Houthi military spokesperson claimed fresh attacks against the U.S. aircraft carrier, USS Harry S. Truman, and other U.S. warships in the northern Red Sea. NativeClick Ads Meanwhile, the U.S. Central Command said in a post on social media platform X that the strike group of the aircraft carrier “continues non-stop 24/7 operations against the Houthis despite the Houthis’ outlandish claims.” According to Houthi media outlets, the total number of U.S. airstrikes on northern Yemen since early Friday morning has increased to 30. The U.S. airstrikes targeted several locations in eastern and southern the capital Sanaa, the adjacent oil-rich province of Marib, and the western province of Hodeidah. In Sanaa, residents heard the loud sound of fighter jets flying over before and after they struck locations on the Mount Nuqum and Bani Hashish districts, both on the eastern outskirts of Sanaa. Also, the airstrikes hit locations in the Sanhan district, on the southern outskirts of the capital. There are no warning siren systems in Yemen to alert residents in advance of any possible air attacks. “All that we hear is the sound of speeding missile less than a second before it hit and exploded, then we hear the sound of fighter jets in full throttle,” a Sanaa resident Mohamed said. On March 15, the U.S. military resumed airstrikes against Houthi targets to deter the group from launching attacks against Israel and U.S. warships in the Red Sea. The Houthis, who control northern Yemen, said they would stop launching attacks if Israel stops its war on Gaza and allows the entry of essential food and medicine into the strip.","houthi claim drone attack israel’ tel aviv","yemen’ houthi group say statement fridai launch fresh drone attack citi tel aviv central israel xinhua report air forc carri qualit militari oper two isra militari target tel aviv us two drone houthi militari spokesperson yahya sarea say statement air houthirun awami leaguemasirah tv spokesperson indic attack carri support palestinian peopl affirm confront ongo american aggress countri will prevent u continu fulfil duti toward gaza sarea ad israel’ channel new report yemeni drone intercept near dead sea within jordanian airspac reach israel jordanian armi confirm late fridai even unidentifi drone enter jordanian airspac crash ma’in area madaba governmenternor near dead sea casualti report even sinc israel renew intens strike march across gaza strip houthi launch frequent attack isra u target early dai houthi militari spokesperson claim fresh attack u aircraft carrier uss harri  truman u warship northern red sea nativeclick ad meanwhil u central command say post social medium platform x strike group aircraft carrier continu nonstop oper houthi despit houthi outlandish claim accord houthi medium outlet total numb u airstrik northern yemen sinc earli fridai morn increas u airstrik target sever locat eastern southern capit sanaa adjac oilrich provinc marib western provinc hodeidah sanaa resid hear loud sound fighter jet fly strike locat mount nuqum bani hashish district eastern outskirt sanaa also airstrik hit locat sanhan district southern outskirt capit warn siren system yemen alert resid advanc possibl air attack hear sound speed missil little 2 hit explod hear sound fighter jet full throttl sanaa resid moham say march u militari resum airstrik houthi target deter group launch attack israel u warship red sea houthi control northern yemen say stop launch attack israel stop war gaza allow entri essenti food medicin strip"

The deal, reached between the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU)/Christian Social Union (CSU) alliance and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), removes a key feature of last year’s naturalisation reform. Introduced in June 2024 by the outgoing SPD-led coalition, the expedited three-year path required applicants to demonstrate advanced C1-level German and strong integration indicators such as community service or academic excellence. Critics within the CDU and CSU had labelled the route “turbo” naturalisation and argued that three years of residency was insufficient for full integration. While the fast-track path will be removed, the standard five-year route to citizenship will remain. This requires applicants to hold an intermediate B1-level of German and continuous residency in the country. Dual citizenship, a controversial topic in Germany’s immigration debate, will also be preserved. Prior to the 2024 reform, dual nationality with non-EU countries was largely prohibited. The change has seen a spike in applications, particularly among Germany’s large Turkish population. NativeClick Ads CDU leader and likely next Chancellor Friedrich Merz had voiced scepticism about dual citizenship but agreed to retain the policy as part of the coalition negotiations with the SPD. The coalition also ruled out revoking citizenship from naturalised dual nationals who support extremist ideologies.

Global biodiversity loss inflicts considerable economic damage measurable in monetary terms, severely affecting agriculture, tourism, and natural resource industries. Immediate impacts are evident, as Sub-Saharan Africa suffers approximately $2.1 billion in agricultural losses annually. Medium-term effects are seen in Southeast Asia, where deteriorating coral reefs have caused an estimated $3.7 billion decline in tourism revenue over recent years. Long-term projections in North America indicate that habitat degradation could reduce natural resource yields by over $4.5 billion in the coming decades. Business leaders and policy makers must prioritize sustainable environmental investments to counteract these quantifiable financial threats and ensure economic resilience. Biodiversity refers to the genetic, species, and ecological (ecosystem) diversity found among all plants, animals, and microorganisms inhabiting the earth's soil, water, and air. The basic needs of humans—such as food, clothing, shelter, and medical care—are sourced from a diverse array of plants and animals. The greater the diversity of species, the more stable and balanced the ecosystem becomes. A rich biodiversity is essential for sustenance, shelter, and overall well-being. Over the past 50 years, unprecedented changes in land and ocean use have been identified as the primary reasons for the loss of biodiversity and ecosystems. Human activities have altered three-quarters of terrestrial environments and nearly 66 percent of marine environments. For example, nearly half of the land in the United States that was once European settlements has been converted into agricultural land. In these transformed areas, yields are 70 percent lower than the national average. In efforts to increase production, a significant amount of biodiversity is being destroyed. However, it is time to consider the economic loss a country incurs by destroying biodiversity. Until we understand the importance of biodiversity to the economy, the issue will not hold significant weight for us. The extent of economic loss due to biodiversity loss in Bangladesh has yet to be determined. Although there have been several initiatives by the government, they have not met with success. The same scenario is observed in most countries around the world. Yet, some economic activities, while seemingly beneficial to humans, are causing significant damage to biodiversity, leading to various crises. These harmful activities are linked to essential sectors such as agriculture, energy, and fisheries. According to a recent report by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), activities aimed at short-term growth in these sectors are destroying biodiversity and escalating crises related to nature, climate, and human health. As a result, the global economy faces a loss of $25 trillion annually. The report warns that a lack of coordination in addressing crises is exacerbating financial losses. Biodiversity loss, climate change, water scarcity, food insecurity, and health risks are still being tackled separately. This not only increases the problems but also raises costs. For three years, 165 scientists have worked on this report, which indicates that industry owners are not considering the environmental and social damages incurred by their business activities. The overlooked costs range from $10 trillion to $25 trillion, which constitutes a quarter of the global GDP. The issue of biodiversity conservation gained significant attention during an international summit held in Brazil in 1992. The total number of species on Earth remains unknown today, and it is uncertain whether it will ever be known. It is estimated that between 5 million and 30 million different species inhabit the planet, with approximately 1.5 million species identified so far. Among these are 751,000 insect species, 281,000 other animal species, 250,000 flowering plants, 68,000 fungi, 26,900 mosses, 30,000 protists, 4,800 bacteria, and 1,000 viruses, among others. However, due to various reckless human activities, an average of 27,000 species is being destroyed each year. Scientists warn that if this continues, a quarter of all species on Earth could be wiped out by 2050. Important Factors to Consider in Assessing the Contribution of Biodiversity Before determining the economic contribution of biodiversity, we must identify the essential sectors from which we receive direct and indirect financial support. Beyond the sectors we can identify, there are countless others that quietly contribute to the national economy through biodiversity. NativeClick Ads The essence of biodiversity conservation lies in providing a safe environment for all living beings. Biodiversity is particularly reliant on water, soil, and forest resources. Life is unsustainable without water. All types of aquatic life, including fish, inhabit surface water. Water is a crucial nutrient, serving as the habitat for fish, which provide 20% of protein for 300 million people. When water becomes polluted, it means the habitats of aquatic life, including fish, are compromised. This is because a decrease in oxygen levels in polluted water makes it impossible for living beings to survive. For example, the Buriganga River, which suffers from pollution, has no fish or aquatic animals. Rainwater fills surface water bodies, with some of it seeping underground, providing people with drinking water. When water bodies are filled in, groundwater cannot replenish. As a result, the water table is dropping each year. During the dry season, many districts in the country face a drinking water crisis. All people on Earth depend on water, air, and food. In terms of livelihoods, approximately 2.6 billion people are engaged in fishing and agricultural production processes globally. About 80% of what we eat comes from agricultural products. Another major area of biodiversity is forests. Eighty percent of terrestrial species live in forests. Among 8,300 species of animals, 8% are extinct, and 22% are at risk of extinction. The livelihoods of nearly 1.6 billion people, including 70 million indigenous people, depend directly and indirectly on forest resources. Moreover, considering the oxygen produced by trees, all people on Earth depend on trees and forest resources. Trees also play an invaluable role in combating negative climate change. Of the 80,000 species of trees in the world, only 1% have been researched for their significant uses. Additionally, approximately 80% of people living in rural areas today use herbal medicines, which are primarily sourced from forest resources. Around 25% of the global population is estimated to work in agriculture. Estimating the economic value of biodiversity in agriculture and through the use of wild species for food is both challenging and controversial. Horticultural plant biodiversity can be highly profitable and provides opportunities for employment. In the UK, growth of ornamental plants was worth £1.7 billion in 2023. Biodiversity is a source of food, medication, and materials used in industry. It plays an important role in industry. It acts as a source of natural resources, materials, and products that are sold, consumed, or used in manufacturing. Recreation and tourism are also examples of human economic activities that rely on these benefits. In 2018, the WWF Living Planet Report argues that the whole global economy of US$125 trillion ultimately relies on nature. The benefits of biodiversity are often evaluated in an anthropocentric way and the inherent value of biodiversity, outside of its benefits to humanity, has been debated by economists. Despite these benefits, economic activities often result in harm to biodiversity, such as through deforestation. The majority of species have yet to be evaluated for their current or future economic importance. Raw materials, pharmaceuticals and drug production all directly and indirectly depend upon biodiversity. Impact of economic activity on biodiversity Even though biodiversity supports the economy, economic activity frequently degrades biodiversity, and since it offers financial incentives, it is frequently prioritized over conservation and restoration efforts. This adds to the worldwide decline in biodiversity, which has several causes, including overexploitation, pollution, habitat loss, and changes in land use. Boston Consulting Group (BCG) estimates that economic activities related to agriculture, infrastructure, fashion, and energy account for over 90% of the anthropogenic drivers of biodiversity loss. Furthermore, the IUCN estimates that mining, energy, infrastructure, and agriculture affect 79% of vulnerable species. It was projected that the loss of terrestrial biodiversity between 2000 and 2010 cost the world economy $500 billion. Long-term risks to society and the economy include an increased likelihood of pandemics, floods, and droughts due to ongoing biodiversity loss and environmental degradation. What Experts Are Saying: What We Should Do and What Solutions Are Available The Bay of Bengal is a blessing for Bangladesh. However, we are carelessly destroying this resource and missing out on the benefits of the marine economy. Biodiversity is crucial to the marine economy, which can be said to be the lifeblood of Bangladesh's national economy. Unfortunately, various factors are putting the marine life and ecosystem of the Bay of Bengal at risk. Instead of prioritizing the extraction of marine energy, we should focus on renewable energy sources such as offshore windmills. The government needs to pay special attention to developing wind energy management as part of its economic management expansion. Renewable energy is both cost-effective and sustainable, providing widespread and long-lasting benefits to the economy. Numerous organizations and institutions are fighting to protect marine habitats and wildlife. It is essential for everyone to be aware of marine life, as a significant part of the economy is tied to the marine sector. To protect biodiversity, all water bodies in the country must be safeguarded from encroachment and pollution. Necessary measures, including dredging, must be taken to enhance the water retention capacity of rivers and other water bodies. The use of all natural resources, including gas, electricity, and fuel, must be regulated, as water is used in their production. The use of tissue and paper should be limited. The sea, seabed, and coastal areas have become the largest zones for privatization. The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea granted coastal countries exclusive economic zones extending 200 nautical miles from their shores. As a result, one-third of the world's marine areas have been transformed into state-owned resources. This has primarily benefited colonial powers connected to remote island regions. France and the United States each received over 11 million square kilometers of marine area, while the United Kingdom obtained 6.8 million square kilometers, which is 27 times more than its land area. Governments in various countries have allowed private organizations access to marine resources. They have granted or sold private property rights in the sea. This has devastated the marine environment and reduced fish populations. Wastewater, chemicals, and plastics are being pumped into the sea. The extraction of mineral resources and tourism is destroying wetlands, mangroves, and other coastal ecosystems. Dr. Mohammad Taj Uddin, Dean of the Faculty of Agricultural Economics & Rural Sociology of Bangladesh Agricultural University, said climate change and human activities pose a significant threat to biodiversity in Bangladesh, similar to the situation worldwide. The adverse effects of climate change on biodiversity are evident in the vast areas of the Sundarbans coastal region of Bangladesh. Illegal deforestation and wildlife extermination, riverbank encroachment, pollution, deforestation, hill cutting, poverty, unplanned urbanization, water and air pollution, industrial waste, excessive use of harmful pesticides, and over-extraction of groundwater have all contributed to the current environmental crisis in Bangladesh. In light of this situation, urgent steps must be taken to conserve biodiversity in geological, aquatic, and marine environments. Dredging must be conducted to increase the navigability of rivers, and effective measures should be implemented for the proper execution of water agreements with India. Reserved forest areas should not be allocated for development projects. Development projects must be undertaken while maintaining a balance between development and biodiversity. It is essential to prevent indiscriminate deforestation and ensure proper management of protected forests. The public must be educated and made aware that forests and wildlife are integral parts of our lives. Professor Rashed Al Mahmood Titumir, Chairman of the Development Studies Department at Dhaka University, stated that past biodiversity targets have not been met. There is a need for several effective accountability mechanisms. First, there must be measurable quantitative targets. All stakeholders in society should know what percentage of land will be restored or how much pollution the government intends to reduce. Monitoring must include target-based milestones. Second, the state's understanding of life and ecosystems remains flawed, and there are significant gaps in the data. The quality of data must be improved. Ultimately, a proper accountability system is necessary. If world leaders wish to fulfill their commitments, this is crucial.

He called the rally one of the most powerful displays of solidarity with Palestine in recent memory. In a statement issued on Saturday (April 12), Ambassador Yousef Ramadan hailed Saturday’s mass rally in Dhaka—dubbed the “March for Gaza”—as a “historic declaration” of support that “will echo across borders and generations.” Thousands of people, including students, imams, artists and civil society members, gathered at Suhrawardy Udyan in Dhaka on April 12, waving Palestinian and Bangladeshi flags in a show of unity. The rally demanded an end to the Israeli occupation and justice for Palestinians. “Dhaka continues to surprise the world with its unparalleled sincerity,” said the ambassador. “Bangladesh has chosen to grant the Palestinian people renewed strength, encouragement, and moral immunity to continue their struggle for freedom and independence.” He described Bangladesh’s stance as “an irreversible decision” to remain on “the right side of history” and stand by Palestine without compromise.

Both countries described the meeting as “constructive” and confirmed a second round of discussions will take place next week - with the US hailing the “direct communication” as being key to striking a possible deal. President Donald Trump pulled the US out of a previous nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers in 2018, and has long said he would make a “better” deal. The talks are seen as an important first step in establishing whether a deal can be done. At two-and-a-half hours, the first meeting was brief, reportedly respectful - and set the stage for a second round. That was probably as good as it could get when Iranian and US officials sat down in Muscat, the capital of Oman - whose top diplomat mediated the primarily indirect negotiations. They were the most significant talks since Trump pulled the US out of the Iran nuclear deal of 2015 during his first term in office. The verdict of Iran’s lead negotiator, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, was positive. NativeClick Ads “In my opinion, as the first meeting, it was a constructive meeting held in a very peaceful and respectful environment, because no inappropriate language was used,” he told Iranian state TV. His diplomatic tone suggests the US team led by Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff did not reiterate some of the president’s threats that Iran would face “great danger” if this dialogue did not succeed. He has repeatedly warned of possible military strikes. This meeting ran with the delegations in separate rooms, relaying messages through Oman’s foreign minister, Badr bin Hamad al-Busaidi. Witkoff, who is leading the US delegation, had previously only spoken of meeting face-to-face. But Araghchi and Witkoff did speak for a few minutes in the presence of Busaidi – not the direct talks US officials said would happen but what could be a small but significant opening. Iran, mindful of pressure from hardliners at home, underlined how limited their face-to-face exchange was, with no photographs taken. In a statement following the talks, the White House said the discussions “were very positive and constructive”, noting that Witkoff had emphasised to Iran that he had instructions to resolve the adversaries’ “differences through dialogue and diplomacy, if that is possible”. “These issues are very complicated, and special envoy Witkoff’s direct communication today was a step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome,” the statement added. Araghchi had said ahead of the discussions that his country wanted a “fair agreement”. After the talks concluded, he said discussions next week may not happen in Oman, but would still be mediated by the Middle Eastern nation. The White House said they would take place next Saturday. “Neither we, nor the other party, want fruitless negotiations, discussions for discussions’ sake, time wasting or talks that drag on forever,” Araghchi told Iranian state television.","u iran hold construct talk nuclear deal","iran u conclud first round talk oman tehran’ nuclear programm highestlevel meet two nation sinc bbc report countri describ meet construct confirm 2 round discuss will take place next week u hail direct commun kei strike possibl deal presid donald trump pull u previou nuclear agreement iran world power long say make good deal talk see import first step establish whether deal can do twoandahalf hour first meet brief reportedli respect set stage 2 round probabl good get iranian u offici sit muscat capit oman whose top diplomat mediat primarili indirect negoti signific talk sinc trump pull u iran nuclear deal first term offic verdict iran’ lead negoti foreign minist abba araghchi posit nativeclick ad opinion first meet construct meet hold peac respect environ inappropri languag us tell iranian state tv diplomat tone suggest u team lead trump envoi steve witkoff reiter president’ threat iran face great danger dialogu succe repeatedli warn possibl militari strike meet run deleg separ room relai messag oman’ foreign minist badr bin hamad awami leaguebusaidi witkoff lead u deleg previous speak meet facetofac araghchi witkoff speak minut presenc busaidi direct talk u offici say happen small signific open iran mind pressur hardlin home underlin limit facetofac exchang photograph take statement follow talk white hous say discuss posit construct note witkoff emphasis iran instruct resolv adversari differ dialogu diplomaci possibl issu complic special envoi witkoff’ direct commun todai step forward achiev mutual benefici outcom statement ad araghchi say ahead discuss countri want fair agreement talk conclud say discuss next week mai happen oman still mediat middl eastern nation white hous say take place next saturdai neither parti want fruitless negoti discuss discuss sake time wast talk drag forev araghchi tell iranian state televis"

This was confirmed in a press release issued by the foreign ministry on Saturday evening. The Romanian minister has proposed initiating a bilateral agreement on migration and mobility to facilitate legal migration between Romania and Bangladesh and the plan was positively received by the Bangladeshi side. Both sides agreed to enhance cooperation in various sectors including agriculture, car and rail industries and trade and investments. The Romanian side further agreed to support the Bangladeshi bid to continue with the GSP plus facilities within the European Union. The meeting had a special focused discussion on sectoral cooperation of mutual interest, said the press release. Bangladesh Ambassador to Türkiye and other senior officials from both the sides attended the meeting. NativeClick Ads The three-day ADF 2025 kicked off on Friday in Antalya hosted by the Turkish Foreign Ministry with the theme, “Reclaiming Diplomacy in a Fragmented World”, under the patronage of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Chaitra Sankranti is an age-old festival of rural Bangla which marks the last day of a Bangla year. The Bangla calendar is solar, with the year beginning on Pahela Baishakh. People from all walks of life celebrate the Baishakhi festival with great enthusiasm. Chaitra is the last month of Basanta (spring season) in Bangla calendar. Its celebration is more widespread in rural areas. It is the day before Pahela Baishakh (the first day of Bangla calendar). On Chaitra Sankranti, the Bangalees bid farewell to the outgoing Bangla year before welcoming the Noboborsho through different festivities. In many places, including the capital, Chaitra Sankranti is celebrated by arranging fairs, musical events and other festivities. The Ministry of Chittagong Hill Tracts Affairs has taken the initiative to bring out the Baisabi procession in the capital today. Men, women and young people from small ethnic groups speaking 10 tribal languages will join the Baisabi festival in colourful costumes.

In a notice, US Customs and Border Patrol said that the goods would be excluded from Trump’s 10% global tariff on most countries and the much larger Chinese import tax. It marks the first significant reprieve of any kind in Trump’s tariffs on China, with one trade analyst describing it as a “game-changer scenario”. Late on Saturday, while travelling to Miami, Trump said he would give more details of the exemptions at the start of next week. “We’ll be very specific,” he told reporters on Air Force One. ""But we're taking in a lot of money. As a country we're taking in a lot of money."" The move came after concerns from US tech companies that the price of gadgets could skyrocket, as many of them are made in China. Exemptions - backdated to 5 April - also include other electronic devices and components, including semiconductors, solar cells and memory cards. ""This is the dream scenario for tech investors,"" Dan Ives, who is the global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, posted on X. ""Smartphones, chips being excluded is a game-changer scenario when it comes to China tariffs."" NativeClick Ads Big tech firms such as Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft and the broader tech industry can breathe a huge sigh of relief this weekend, he added. The White House indicated the exemptions were made to ensure companies had more time to move production to the US. ""President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops,"" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. ""At the direction of the president, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible."" Trump, who is spending the weekend at his Florida home, told reporters on Friday he was comfortable with the high tariffs on China. ""And I think something positive is going to come out of that,"" he said, touting his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping. These electronic goods are still subject to the 20% tariff on China related to fentanyl, White House Deputy Chief of Staff on Policy Stephen Miller posted on X. Some estimates suggested iPhone prices in the US could have as much as tripled if costs were passed on to consumers. The US is a major market for iPhones, while Apple accounted for more than half of its smartphones sales last year, according to Counterpoint Research. It says as much as 80% of Apple's iPhones intended for US sale are made in China, with the remaining 20% made in India. Like its fellow smartphone giant Samsung, Apple has been trying to diversify its supply chains to avoid an over-reliance on China in recent years. India and Vietnam emerged as frontrunners for additional manufacturing hubs. As the tariffs took effect, Apple reportedly looked to speed up and increase its production of India-produced devices in recent days. Trump had planned for a host of steep tariffs on countries around the world to take effect this week. But on Wednesday he announced he would implement a 90-day pause for countries hit by higher US tariffs - except China, whose tariffs he raised to 145%. Trump said the tariff increase for China was because of the country's readiness to retaliate with its own 84% levy on US goods. In a dramatic change of policy, Trump said all countries that had not retaliated against US tariffs would receive the reprieve – and only face a blanket tariff of 10% – until July. The White House then said the move was a negotiating tactic to extract more favourable trade terms from other countries. Trump has said his import taxes will address unfairness in the global trading system, as well as bring jobs and factories back to the US.","trump exempt smartphon comput new tariff","u presid donald trump administr exempt smartphon comput electron devic reciproc tariff includ levi impos chine import bbc report notic u custom border patrol say good exclud trump global tariff countri much large chine import tax mark first signific repriev kind trump tariff china on trade analyst describ gamechang scenario late saturdai travel miami trump say give detail exempt start next week we’ll specif tell report air forc on take lot monei countri take lot monei move come concern u tech compani price gadget skyrocket mani make china exempt backdat april also includ electron devic compon includ semiconductor solar cell memori card dream scenario tech investor dan iv global head technologi research wedbush secur post x smartphon chip exclud gamechang scenario come china tariff nativeclick ad big tech firm appl nvidia microsoft broad tech industri can breath huge sigh relief weekend ad white hous indic exempt make ensur compani time move product u presid trump make clear america reli china manufactur critic technologi semiconductor chip smartphon laptop white hous press secretari karolin leavitt say statement direct presid compani hustl onshor manufactur unit state soon possibl trump spend weekend florida home tell report fridai comfort high tariff china think someth posit go come say tout relationship chine presid xi jinp electron good still subject tariff china relat fentanyl white hous deputi chief staff polici stephen miller post x estim suggest iphon price u much tripl cost pass consum u major market iphon appl account half smartphon sale last year accord counterpoint research sai much appl iphon intend u sale make china remain make india like fellow smartphon giant samsung appl try diversifi suppli chain avoid overreli china recent year india vietnam emerg frontrunn addit manufactur hub tariff take effect appl reportedli look speed increas product indiaproduc devic recent dai trump plan host steep tariff countri around world take effect week wednesdai announc implement dai paus countri hit high u tariff except china whose tariff rais trump say tariff increas china countri readi retali levi u good dramat chang polici trump say countri retali u tariff receiv repriev face blanket tariff juli white hous say move negoti tactic extract favour trade term countri trump say import tax will address unfair global trade system good bring job factori back u"

"science-technology","https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111648","Preventing global warm, carbon offset could be worthy alternative","13/04/2025","Carbon credits are one of the major pillars of most of the country's climate change strategy. Though many experts stated that, depending on offsets to meet emission reduction goals are mathematically impossible and a recipe for climate disaster. However, it serves as one of the most effective tools in the face of climate change. Since the Industrial Revolution, humanity has emitted over two thousand gigatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The heat-trapping greenhouse gases have created a layer in the atmosphere, resulting in global warming. If we do not reduce global warming, the adverse effects of climate change—such as wildfires, heat waves, rising sea levels, floods, and droughts—will continue to escalate. To combat climate change, it is essential to rapidly prevent the emission of greenhouse gases. This includes increasing the use of renewable energy and halting deforestation. Controlling highly polluting gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide is crucial. However, these efforts alone are not sufficient to halt climate change. Scientists have stated that global temperatures must be kept below 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius, which is necessary to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. We need not only to reduce carbon emissions but also to remove and store some carbon from the atmosphere. In fact, most climate models suggest that by 2050, we need to remove hundreds of millions of metric tons of carbon dioxide annually while also accelerating the pace of carbon reduction. The 'carbon offset' method plays a vital role as an effective and natural way to remove carbon from the atmosphere. In this method, those who emit carbon in the atmosphere will fund others to remove that carbon as compensation. They will sequester carbon in the soil by planting or cultivating trees in regenerative practices or by using specific technologies. Carbon-emitting groups will finance the carbon-removing groups. How Carbon Offsetting Can Be Achieved First, by capturing and destroying greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere, such as methane gas capture projects at landfills. Second, by utilizing clean and renewable energy. This serves as an alternative to the greenhouse gases released from the use of natural gas. Third, through regenerative agricultural practices. This establishes a conservation and restoration process for food production, enhancing soil fertility, making the soil arable again, improving water flow quality, increasing biodiversity, and preventing soil erosion. Such agricultural systems can sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide in the form of carbon in the soil, which also contributes to soil fertility. In other words, carbon offsetting is achieved through carbon sequestration using this method. Fourth, another way to introduce carbon into the soil is through biochar. This is a type of charcoal made by burning organic matter such as crop residues, grass, trees, or other plants at temperatures of 300 to 600 degrees Celsius in the absence of oxygen. This process, known as pyrolysis, can prevent the loss of carbon from organic matter. Biochar is a stable form of carbon that cannot easily escape into the atmosphere. By preserving carbon in the soil, biochar increases soil fertility and reduces the need for chemical fertilizers. Fifth, certain minerals naturally react with carbon dioxide, transforming it from a gas into a solid substance. This process is commonly referred to as carbon mineralization. Naturally, this occurs very slowly, taking hundreds or thousands of years. However, scientists are discovering methods to accelerate the carbon mineralization process. In this method, carbon dioxide is introduced into suitable rocks or minerals, where it reacts to turn gaseous carbon dioxide into solid carbonate. Sixth, the use of carbon capture technology, or KMCIDR. This technology has been developed for capturing carbon dioxide from heavy industrial factories. Industries and power generation plants that burn hydrocarbons to produce electricity can utilize this technology. This method can capture up to 90 percent of carbon dioxide from flue gases emitted by power plants. This technology has the capacity to capture 300 kilograms of carbon dioxide per day, totaling nearly 116 million tons annually. Bangladesh has begun the journey Bangladesh has begun participating in carbon offsetting, primarily through initiatives like the Solar Home System, which have generated significant carbon credits. These credits are traded on international markets, providing financial incentives for reducing emissions. Bangladesh also has a target of reducing carbon emissions by 22% by 2030 and aims to source 30% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030 and 40% by 2041. Limitations regarding Carbon offsetting Despite being a useful tool, carbon offsetting has drawbacks. It should not be used in place of direct emission reductions because doing so alone may cause operational improvements to be delayed and high-emission activities to continue. The caliber and legitimacy of offset initiatives are other issues some may not produce the savings that were promised or may have unfavorable effects. Measuring and confirming emissions, guaranteeing the stability of carbon sequestration, and avoiding greenwashing are other difficulties. However, along with other preventive measures, countries should plan for this approach. Some countries in South Asia, including Bangladesh and India, and many countries in Europe have already taken plans and activities in this regard. Bangladesh also aims to reduce carbon emissions. Global leaders have reached a consensus to decrease greenhouse gas emissions to make the world more livable, aiming for net-zero carbon pollution by 2050. Bangladesh is joining this initiative. The government has implemented various plans and measures to reduce carbon emissions. Like many others, Bangladesh wants to move away from fossil fuel usage. Recently, the government has shut down several coal-fired power plants while keeping the ongoing ones operational. According to sources in the Power Division, no new coal-fired power plants will be constructed beyond the existing ones at Payra, Rampal, and Matarbari. This decision has led to the cancellation of at least two mega projects in Payra, one in Rampal, and three in Matarbari, along with one project each in Khulna, Munshiganj and Chattogram. NativeClick Ads When asked about the gains and losses from this decision, an official from the Power Division stated that there will be less coal burned. The demand for electricity will inevitably arise, and the government plans to meet that demand by utilizing clean fuels. As a result, carbon emissions will decrease. The government is placing emphasis on renewable energy. Brick kilns are significant contributors to environmental pollution, as they burn wood to produce bricks. This not only leads to carbon emissions but also increases pollution due to the removal of topsoil. The government states that alongside auto brick kilns, blocks will be produced to meet demand. Some factories for producing hollow blocks have already been established in the country. Experts estimate that using blocks will reduce construction costs by 30%. Additionally, homes built with blocks remain cool in the summer and warm in the winter, which will also lessen cooling and heating loads. There are approximately 8,000 brick kilns in the country, with 1,789 located in and around Dhaka. Dhaka alone has 487 brick kilns, which contribute nearly 58% to the city's pollution. Meanwhile, the government is also looking to produce energy-efficient appliances. The Sustainable Renewable Energy Authority has already begun working on star labeling. The aim of this project is to encourage the use of energy-efficient devices. In this context, Dr. Syeda Rizwana Hasan, an adviser to the interim government of Bangladesh, stated, we have taken several initiatives for carbon control. We are prioritizing renewable energy. Work is ongoing to modernize brick kilns, and we have also initiated measures to control vehicle pollution. What Experts Are Saying Climate scientist Dr. Abed Chowdhury states that removing carbon from the atmosphere and storing it in the soil is a crucial part of carbon offsetting. By measuring the amount of organic matter in the soil both before and after carbon storage, it is possible to determine how much carbon has been removed or retained. Based on the extent of carbon removal and retention, compensation can be sought from companies responsible for greenhouse gas emissions. He further explains that agriculture-dependent countries like Bangladesh can earn a certain amount of money by participating in carbon offsetting. They can even choose carbon offsetting as a means of livelihood. We believe there is nothing impossible for humanity. Those who once emerged from the interiors of Africa and conquered the world will now find a way to navigate through this crisis of global warming. Professor Dr. Zillur Rahman, director of the Disaster Science and Climate Resilience Department at Dhaka University, says that if we want to avoid negative impacts, we must adopt certain measures. In this case, reducing carbon emissions should be the primary focus. It is not enough to simply plant trees we must also decrease our reliance on oil, gas, and other fossil fuels that release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Industries need to establish environmentally sensitive frameworks. In developed countries, a carbon footprint assessment is conducted before any institution or building is constructed. Although we have building codes here, the issue of carbon footprint has not yet been addressed. Dr. Zillur Rahman adds that while green technology may be expensive, its implementation can be initiated in our country. Although it may involve substantial costs now, we will reap the benefits in the long run. When we are able to reduce the temperature spikes in the atmosphere, the entire world will adopt us as a model.

However, people residing in Bangladesh still today, despite the enactment of the Arbitration Act 2001, do not properly comprehend the idea of ADR. Although slowly the justice system of Bangladesh will fully integrate ADR and people will have sufficient knowledge about it, the enactment of the Arbitration Act 2001 was one of the first steps, and mediation can be traced in the Family Courts Ordinance of 1985. Benefits of ADR: Before implementing ADR services or advocating the increased significance of ADR in Bangladesh, its benefits must be assessed. To begin with, ADR is cost-friendly this is because lower legal fees are associated with ADR methods. Also, since parties avoid court litigation, a huge sum of money is being saved, and usually parties going for ADR fully settle their issues, so there is no chance of appeal like in the court litigation scenarios, hence saving further costs. ADR services like mediation, arbitration, and negotiation are very time-friendly compared to litigation since a settlement can be reached quickly, also because of a smaller number of procedural delays, and these methods also provide flexibility. ADR maintains confidentiality and privacy, providing protection to secret and sensitive information of the parties for example, if a large business implements ADR like arbitration, their trade secrets will be protected as a result, and both their corporate and personal reputations are safeguarded. Unlike the hectic procedure of court litigation, ADR services provide a more relaxed environment for the parties that ensures emotional well-being. Moreover, when a party goes through court litigation, the ruling of the court can be damaging for one party however, ADR is focused on a win-win situation for both parties when resolving a dispute, causing minimal damage to both parties and saving their reputation in the long run. ADR also reduces the excess number of cases that go for litigation, which reduces the pressure from court, as unwanted or a huge number of cases can be solved through ADR. Why ADR is not implemented in Bangladesh: It is important to examine the people’s lack of knowledge when it comes to ADR in Bangladesh only a few businesses, certain legal professionals, and a few institutions know about ADR, but in general, people only run after court litigation. A lot of people in Bangladesh are unaware of the operations and functions of their country’s legal field hence, the concept of ADR is alien to them. Despite acknowledgement of ADR in Bangladesh via the Arbitration Act 2001 and the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act 2003, ADR still lacks institutional promotion, as it is visible that citizens do not know about any well-established ADR centres, which restricts the implementation of ADR services like arbitration and mediation also, no initiatives on such establishments are taken, for example, the Bangladesh International Arbitration Centre (BIAC) is not known by many and underutilised, although established in 2011. Another issue is that the litigants of Bangladesh do not communicate with clients about ADR this is because a lot of the lawyers themselves do not know about the advantages of ADR or do not fully understand the potential of ADR or do not talk about it openly due to lack of incentives, resulting in further slow popularity of ADR, making the court litigation busier with unwanted cases. Another issue that may be seen is that people do not trust ADR services compared to litigation this emerged probably because of the lack of knowledge they have about ADR, and so they do not want to explore ADR like arbitration or mediation and risk their complaints. Moreover, some enforcement issues can be seen as well, despite Arbitration’s arbitral award being acknowledged in the Arbitration Act 2001 the provisions that are found in the Arbitration Act 2001 and the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act 2003 lack appropriate enforcement, as there is no proper body in Bangladesh that maintains proper regulations of ADR services, decreasing the efficiency of such services and leading towards persistent delay. Solution and Why ADR Will Help Bangladesh: Fortunately, regardless of all these problems, it is still possible to make ADR popular in Bangladesh. First of all, a way should be figured out to promote ADR through court for this, the UK’s pre-action protocol, which is followed in civil claims, or something similar to the pre-action protocol, can be introduced. So basically, in the UK, before commencing litigation, both parties have to follow the pre-action protocol, and in this pre-action, courts highly recommend ADR, like arbitration, and if a party skips ADR unnecessarily, they get penalised by the court later. If something similar to this is introduced, the knowledge of ordinary people of Bangladesh about ADR will increase. If successfully, ADR is promoted in front of the general public of Bangladesh, ADR centres like BIAC will not be underutilised anymore, as they will be used more, leading to the government making investments for ADR centres or even expanding ADR centres from major cities to rural areas. This simple method will make the public of Bangladesh explore ADR, which will make them more aware of the system of ADR, and once they explore it, chances are they may like the system due to the benefits it offers thus, their trust in ADR will also increase. Moreover, the issue of lack of knowledge of lawyers can easily be countered by the Bangladesh Bar Council they can create a training certification program for lawyers on ADR, and they can also integrate a topic of ADR in bar examinations. For the new generation of lawyers, a subject of ADR can be added to their LLB program in universities of Bangladesh, like in India, where ADR has been added as a subject in the undergraduate program under many law schools and universities. A system of performance-based fees can be introduced for ADR so that lawyers do not think ADR is not worthy and advise the clients about it. If this is done successfully, it will mean lawyers will be trained in the field of ADR, so whenever one corporation goes into a contract with another corporation, of course they seek a lawyer’s advice, and since the lawyers of the new generation hold knowledge of ADR, they are likely to advise their clients to add an ADR clause to the contract, thus further promoting the system. NativeClick Ads Furthermore, the enforcement issue of ADR can be dealt with easily. This can be done by establishing a strong regulatory body for ADR in Bangladesh. Further, stronger rules and regulations can be developed, which can be done by strengthening ADR guidelines that can be maintained by the strong regulatory body for ADR this body can also ensure and improve transparency in arbitration. Even backup from court can be used for enforcement of arbitral awards, which is clearly mentioned in the statutory provision of the Arbitration Act 2001. This will mean court-annexed ADR, which is already available in Bangladesh through the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act 2003. Additionally, in order to bring more innovation and development in the system of ADR, all the nations that are implementing ADR or countries where the significance of ADR is increasing slowly can build a forum where ADR specialists from different countries can share their own experiences and ideas in order to promote ADR further and enhance the ADR services more this is highly beneficial since there is a growth of international commerce and businesses that usually go for ADR services like arbitration due to global enforceability, for being both time- and cost-friendly. In Bangladesh, there is an excess number of cases in court litigation as about 4.2 million lawsuits are pending in the courts, pressurizing the courts with a lot of cases due to the absence of appropriate ADR services as a result, many cases are pending for a long time. William Gladstone mentions, “Justice delayed is justice denied,” which has been the scene in Bangladesh’s judiciary because of the large number of cases justice is not being served in a timely manner, and justice is costly, so this is the time to give ADR an active role in Bangladesh. In Italy during 2010-2011 had a similar issue like in Bangladesh, at this time the number of cases that has been pending in the Italian courts rose to 5.4 million, for which mediation was made mandatory through Decree 28/2010, despite this facing resistance at first mandatory mediation obtained success as tens of thousands of cases was mediated since March 2011. Making mediation mandatory is not suggested, but if ADR can make a huge change in Italy, then Bangladesh should implement it to sustain a better legal system to make it better and relieve the pressure on it. Another example would be Canada, where ADR grew in the 1980s and 1990s and soon became effective. Canada’s Supreme Court in Hryniak v Mauldin mentions the rule of law can be upheld through proper access to justice and acknowledges the new adjudication methods. If implementing ADR helps countries like Canada and Italy to decrease pressure from courts and improves the quality of justice, then enhancing the legal framework of ADR will also benefit Bangladesh. Lastly, applying ADR in Bangladesh also upholds the constitution of Bangladesh. The preamble of the constitution of Bangladesh believes in the rule of law and access to justice for all the citizens, aligning with ADR services goals. Moreover, Article 27 of Bangladesh’s constitution ensures equality before the law, and Article 35 mentions, in respect of trial and punishment, both can be safeguarded via ADR methods. Conclusion: Peacemaker Kenneth Cloke, founder of Mediation Beyond Borders International, indicates that without disorder, no new world is created likewise, the legal system of Bangladesh has already gone through a lot of issues now it is time to heal it by proper integration of ADR, securing the future.

The Nobel laureate died in Peru’s capital Lima surrounded by his family and “at peace,” his son Alvaro Vargas Llosa, a well-known political commentator, said on X. Rumors of the writer’s deteriorating health had spread in recent months, during which he had been living out of the public eye. Vargas Llosa was a leading figure in Latin America's1960s literary scene. He continued to write novels and essays for decades, with his works being translated into many languages. Vargas Llosa was granted honorary doctorates, prizes and awards worldwide throughout his lifetime. The most prestigious award was undoubtedly the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2010, which the Swedish Academy awarded him for ""his cartography of the structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual's resistance, revolt and defeat."" ""We would be worse than we are without the good books we have read, more conformist, not as restless, more submissive, and the critical spirit, the engine of progress, would not even exist. Like writing, reading is a protest against the insufficiencies of life,"" said Vargas Llosa in his acceptance speech at the Swedish Academy in Stockholm on December 7, 2010. ""Good literature erects bridges between different peoples, and by having us enjoy, suffer, or feel surprise, unites us beneath the languages, beliefs, habits, customs, and prejudices that separate us,"" he added. In 2016, he became the first living Spanish-speaking writer to be included in France's Bibliotheque de la Pleiade, a venerable collection of universal classics translated into French, and he was elected a member of the prestigious Academie Francaise in 2021. NativeClick Ads Born Jorge Mario Pedro Vargas Llosa to a middle-class family on March 28, 1936 in Arequipa, Peru, he spent the early years of his childhood in Bolivia before returning to his native country. As a teenager, he attended a military academy in Lima, and soon started working as a local journalist. A student of law and literature, Vargas Llosa started to write short stories first published in the late 1950s. He moved to Paris in 1959, and lived there for several years._Agencies","nobel laureat mario varga llosa di","peruvian writer mario varga llosa pass awai sundai april ag nobel laureat di peru’ capit lima surround famili peac son alvaro varga llosa wellknown polit comment say x rumor writer’ deterior health spread recent month live public ey varga llosa lead figur latin america iss literari scene continu write novel essai decad work translat mani languag varga llosa grant honorari doctor prize award worldwid throughout lifetim prestigi award undoubtedli nobel prize literatur swedish academi award cartographi structur power trenchant imag individu resist revolt defeat wors without good book read conformist restless submiss critic spirit engin progress even exist like write read protest insuffici life say varga llosa accept speech swedish academi stockholm decemb good literatur erect bridg differ peopl u enjoi suffer feel surpris unit u beneath languag belief habit custom prejudic separ u ad becam first live spanishspeak writer includ franc bibliothequ de la pleiad vener collect univers classic translat french elect member prestigi academi francais nativeclick ad bear jorg mario pedro varga llosa middleclass famili march arequipa peru spend earli year childhood bolivia return nativ countri teenag attend militari academi lima soon start work local journalist student law literatur varga llosa start write short stori first publish late  move pari live sever yearsag"

Barshobaran Ananda Shubhajatra is not political program . . . this year we used mask of fascists for not the purpose of politics”, he said. The adviser said this while inaugurating the Noboborsho Ananda Shobhajatra-1432 on the Dhaka University campus on Monday. The adviser said, “Previously, a particular political group used this cultural Shobhajatra at Dhaka University as a tool to defeat their political opponents.” “However, there are some historical political ingredients in this year's Noboborsho observation including the traditions of the Akbar era and the traditions of the Sultanate era but there is nothing typical politics here,” Farooki said. Commenting on the renaming of the procession, he said Ananda Shobhajatra was started in the Fine Arts faculty in 1989. Later in 1996, it was changed to Mangal Shobhajatra. This time the authorities reinstated again to ‘Borshoborn Ananda Shobhajatra’, adding, “There was no incident of imposition, it was imposed earlier. The name was Borshoboron Shobhajatra in Jessore. When it came to Dhaka, it was named Ananda Shobhajatra. Afterwards, Mangal Shobhajatra was imposed”. “This time, Fine Arts has decided to get back to the name with which the observation was started here,” he added. Marking this year's celebration as a big step towards cultural unity and integration among Bangladeshi people, he said Pahela Boishakh is not a festival of 'Bangalees' rather it is a festival of Bangladeshi people. This celebration was made a festival of only 'Bangalees' excluding the people of other communities.

The former premier died at 7:10 pm (1110 GMT) at the National Heart Institute in the capital Kuala Lumpur, his son-in-law and former health minister Khairy Jamaluddin said in an Instagram post, without specifying a cause of death. Abdullah was admitted to the National Heart Institute on Sunday after experiencing breathing difficulties and was immediately placed under intensive care, the institute said in a statement. “Despite all medical efforts, he passed away peacefully, surrounded by his loved ones,” the institute said. Abdullah became Malaysia’s fifth prime minister in 2003, following the resignation of veteran leader Mahathir Mohamad after 22 years at the helm. As premier of the Muslim-majority country, Abdullah embarked on an anti-corruption drive and espoused a moderate version of Islam that aimed for economic and technological progress over religious fundamentalism. But he came under public criticism for his review of fuel subsidies that saw a sharp spike in prices. Abdullah stepped down in 2009, a year after an election that saw the then-ruling Barisan Nasional coalition lose its parliamentary supermajority for the first time in the country’s history. He was succeeded by Najib Razak.","exmalaysia pm abdullah di","former malaysian prime minist abdullah ahmad badawi pass awai mondai april ag reuter report quot famili medic author former premier di prime minist gmt nation heart institut capit kuala lumpur soninlaw former health minist khairi jamaluddin say instagram post without specifi caus death abdullah admit nation heart institut sundai experienc breath difficulti immedi place intens care institut say statement despit medic effort pass awai peacefulli surround love on institut say abdullah becam malaysia’ 5 prime minist follow resign veteran leader mahathir mohamad year helm premier muslimmajor countri abdullah embark anticorrupt drive espous moder version islam aim econom technolog progress religi fundament come public critic review fuel subsidi see sharp spike price abdullah step year elect see thenrul barisan nasion coalit lose parliamentari supermajor first time country’ histori succeed najib razak"

A year after President Bola Tinubu came to power promising to end widespread insecurity, attacks in the northwest by armed gangs, often referred to as bandits, have become almost routine, with authorities seemingly powerless to stop them. Dozens of gunmen on motorbikes stormed Yargoje in the Kankara local government area of Katsina state late on Sunday, according to resident Hassan Ya’u. “They shot sporadically at people, claiming the lives of more than 50 (of us), including my younger brother,” he told Reuters by phone. He added that an unknown number of villagers had been abducted and properties looted. Another resident, Abdullahi Yunusa Kankara, said he narrowly escaped the onslaught and that it continued into the early hours of Monday. “Our town has turned into a death zone. Almost every house in the village has fallen victim to this attack.” Kankara added: “We are currently carrying out a headcount to determine how many people have been abducted. More dead bodies were recovered this morning.” Katsina police authorities did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Attacks in rural areas and kidnapping for ransom are rife in northern Nigeria, a region blighted by a 15-year-long Islamist insurgency in the northeast and frequent deadly clashes between farmers and herders in north-central areas.

Last week, the RSF launched an intense ground and aerial assault on refugee camps surrounding the city of El-Fasher in an attempt to seize the last state capital in Darfur held by their rival, the Sudanese army. The two warring sides have been locked in a bloody power struggle since April 2023. This has created the world’s largest humanitarian crisis and forced millions to flee their homes. The UN said it had verified 148 killings between Thursday and Saturday, but warned the toll was much higher. Senior international officials will gather in London later to discuss the ongoing civil war in Sudan on the second anniversary of the start of the conflict. UN spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said their verification process was still ongoing and their number of those killed did not include Sunday’s violence. “Credible sources have reported more than 400 killed,” said Ms Shamdasani. At least nine humanitarian aid workers were among those killed, the UN said. NativeClick Ads The refugee camps that surround El-Fasher - Zamzam and Abu Shouk - provide temporary homes to more than 700,000 people, many of whom are facing famine-like conditions. In a statement released on Saturday, the RSF said it was not responsible for attacks on civilians and that scenes of killing in Zamzam were staged to discredit its forces. The following day, the group said it had completed a “successful liberation” of the camp from Sudan’s army. The RSF accused the army of using Zamzam as “a military barracks, and innocent civilians as human shields”. El-Fasher is the last major town in Darfur under army control and has been under siege by the RSF for a year. Sudan’s brutal civil war will enter its third year on Tuesday.

The one-day conference will bring foreign ministers and leading humanitarian leaders together at a conference in London regarding humanitarian crisis in Sudan. In a statement, the British Foreign Office said that international representatives will discuss how to achieve a peaceful end to the conflict and address the issues preventing aid reaching those most in need. Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary David Lammy will announce new life-saving aid, worth £120 million ($158.4 million) to support over 650,000 Sudanese people. He will also identify steps to improve humanitarian access and find a long-term political solution to the ongoing crisis, added in the statement. Since April 15, 2023, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has been battling the army for control of Sudan, resulting in thousands of deaths and one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. More than 20,000 victims have been killed and 15 million displaced, according to the UN and local authorities. Research from US scholars, however, estimates the death toll at around 130,000. In recent weeks, the RSF has lost significant territory across Sudan to government forces.

On 15 April 2023, a bloody civil war broke out between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the armed group Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The war has led to the deaths of more than 150,000 people, and millions have been displaced. The violence that exploded and the crisis that followed came on top of several decades of conflict and crises that have hit the population hard, especially in the peripheries, such as the Darfur region in the west, or Kordofan in the south of the country. “This April, it will be two years since the war in Sudan broke out,” says Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). Nearly 15 million people have been displaced, and about half of the population needs humanitarian assistance.","world’ large humanitarian crisi sudan","uk tuesdai will cohost confer london alongsid african union eu franc germani mark twoyear anniversari conflict sudan onedai confer will bring foreign minist lead humanitarian leader togeth confer london regard humanitarian crisi sudan statement british foreign offic say intern repres will discuss achiev peac end conflict address issu prevent aid reach need meanwhil foreign secretari david lammi will announc new lifesav aid worth million million support sudanes peopl will also identifi step improv humanitarian access find longterm polit solut ongo crisi ad statement sinc april rapid support forc rsf battl armi control sudan result thousand death on world’ bad humanitarian crise victim kill million displac accord un local author research u scholar howev estim death toll around recent week rsf lose signific territori across sudan governmentern forc nativeclick ad past two year assist nearli million peopl world’ large humanitarian crisi april bloodi civil war break sudanes arm forc saf arm group rapid support forc rsf war lead death peopl million displac violenc explod crisi follow come top sever decad conflict crise hit popul hard especi peripheri darfur region west kordofan south countri april will two year sinc war sudan break sai jan egeland secretari gener norwegian refuge council nrc nearli million peopl displac half popul need humanitarian assist"

The overall plan wants to slash the State Department budget by about half. The new budget must be approved by Congress, and lawmakers could decide to restore some or all of the funding the administration has proposed cutting. The State Department was due to respond to the OMB proposal on Tuesday. During US President Donald Trump's first term he proposed cutting about a third of diplomacy and aid budgets.

Director General of South Asia Wing at Bangladesh's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) Ishrat Jahan welcomed her upon arrival at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport. Foreign Secretary Md Jashim Uddin and Pakistan's Foreign Secretary Baloch will lead the Bangladesh and Pakistan sides respectively at the FOC to be held at the state guest house Padma. The two sides are expected to discuss the entire range of bilateral issues, a foreign ministry's official said on Tuesday noting that as no specific agenda has been fixed, all areas of mutual interest are likely to be covered during the discussion. The official said, “After such a long hiatus, it is difficult to prioritize topics in advance, but the talks will be comprehensive.” Bangladesh's High Commissioner to Pakistan, Md Iqbal Hussain Khan, who is currently in Dhaka to attend the meeting, said Islamabad is particularly keen to enhance trade ties with Dhaka. “Pakistan sees potential for boosting exports to Bangladesh, especially if their products are price competitive,” he said. The envoy added that as Pakistan serves as a gateway for goods from Afghanistan and Iran, there is scope for Bangladesh to explore imports via Pakistan, provided transport costs remain low. On the issue of direct air connectivity, High Commissioner Khan said that apart from Fly Jinnah, another Pakistani private carrier, Air Sial-based in Sialkot-has applied to the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) to operate flights to Dhaka. The direct air link is anticipated to boost tourism and promote greater people-to-people contact between the two countries, the envoy noted. When asked about unresolved historical issues between the two nations, the high commissioner said such matters often persist in bilateral relations worldwide, but those should not hinder current engagement or economic cooperation. During her stay in Dhaka, Foreign Secretary Baloch is expected to pay courtesy calls on Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus and Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain following the FOC on Thursday.

Previously, this expensive test had to be done in India or other countries. With the initiative and dedication of the National Institute of Neurosciences and Hospital, along with the support of 'Cure SMA Bangladesh' the only organization in the country working on this condition, this significant achievement has been made possible. The National Institute of Laboratory Medicine and Referral Center provided technical assistance for the test. To mark the release of the test results, a special clinic was held on Tuesday (April 15) at the National Institute of Neurosciences and Hospital in Agargaon. On this day, the results of the SMA tests were handed over to the patients. This marks the first clinical test for this disease in Bangladesh, representing an important addition to the treatment of this rare condition. The event, named the 'Neuromuscular Disease Treatment Center' or 'SMA Clinic' provides medical services and consultations for patients with the rare SMA disease.

BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir handed over the letter to the chief adviser at the State Guest House Jamuna on Wednesday afternoon. In the letter titled ‘Opinions and suggestions on some urgent matters to be done in the prevailing situation in the country’, BNP has mentioned the end of the Awami League rule and the ouster of the rulers through mass uprising in July-August 2024. In the letter, BNP mentioned that in the long 16-year struggle, more than 1700 opposition leaders and activists have been victims of enforced disappearances, more than a thousand have been killed, and more than 6 million leaders and activists have been injured, maimed, and harassed in cases of disappearance. In addition, more than two thousand youths, students, workers, and women and children have sacrificed their lives in the mass uprising of July-August 2024, and thousands more have been injured and maimed. The letter says that starting from the Great Liberation War, BNP has always worked for the welfare of the people as a leader or active partner in every struggle to restore democracy and human rights. To that end, BNP has supported the interim government led by Prof Yunus in taking over the governance of the state in accordance with the constitution to deliver the benefits of the July-August 2024 students-workers-people uprising to the countrymen and create a sustainable platform to fulfill their aspirations, and has assured full cooperation and continued cooperation. BNP expressed the hope that the people's long-standing expectation from Prof Yunus and the interim government led by him is to quickly bring the fascist party, their party government and associates under the law, prosecute crimes against the people and humanity, prosecute corruption and looting, and return the laundered money, ensure compensation and proper medical treatment for the dead and injured, contain commodity prices and improve law and order, and return state power to the people through a free, fair and impartial national parliamentary election. BNP believes that changes and reforms in the constitution, laws, rules and institutions are essential for holding a free and impartial election. In this regard, they will support any initiative of the government. NativeClick Ads In the letter, BNP termed both the theories of ‘development first, democracy later’ and ‘reform first, democracy later’ as wrong. They believe that development for all is possible only by strengthening and implementing the democratic system and for this, reforms in the state system, laws and policies are necessary. BNP claims that almost all the epoch-making reforms in the history of the country’s politics and economy have come from their hands. They mentioned the 19-point reform programme of Shaheed President Ziaur Rahman, the Vision-2030 of the country’s leader Begum Khaleda Zia and the 27-point reform programme of acting chairman Tarique Rahman for repairing the state structure and the 31-point reform programme announced with the opinions of other parties. BNP said that the ongoing process of reform is part of their declaration and they welcome any ‘reasonable discussion’. However, they do not support the strategy of depriving the people of their voting rights by wasting time for the interests of parties or groups concerned. BNP had earlier conveyed some of its concerns and suggestions to the Chief Adviser on November 21 last year and February 10 this year, but they stated that no discussion was held on those issues. In addition, BNP believes that the government's activities are being hampered by the fact that 764 officials who were discriminated against by the fascist government were promoted but not posted, and demanded their immediate posting. In the letter, BNP emphasized the 'coordination' in the statements of the state's chief executive and the government, and said that the recent 'exceptions' in this have 'worried' them. They want to have confidence in the Chief Adviser, but feel that the statements of some individuals and supporters of his government have created confusion and called for necessary action in this regard. BNP further said that the 'great responsibility' of restoring the democratic rights of the people has been entrusted to the Chief Adviser and they hope that it will be fulfilled as soon as possible. BNP called for an immediate announcement of a specific electoral roadmap with a view to holding the national elections by December. They also proposed to place the NID project under the Election Commission and quickly resolve the legal complications of re-delimitation of constituencies. At the same time, the BNP demanded speedy trial of those involved in the fascist party and their government, compensation and proper treatment for those killed and injured in the July-August uprising, improving the commodity prices and law and order, and withdrawal of false and harassing cases filed during 1/11 and the fascist regime. At the end of the letter, Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir urged the chief adviser to quickly complete the necessary reforms and end the confusion created in the public mind by announcing a specific roadmap for the national elections by next December.","bnp write letter ca letter sai","bangladesh nationalist parti bnp secretari gener mirza fakhrul islam alamgir write long letter chief advis dr muhammad yunu behalf parti regard prevail situat countri bnp secretari gener mirza fakhrul islam alamgir hand letter chief advis state guest hous jamuna wednesdai afternoon letter titl opinion suggest urgent matter do prevail situat countri bnp mention end awami leagu rule ouster ruler mass upris julyaugust letter bnp mention long year struggl opposit leader activist victim enforc disappear thousand kill million leader activist injur maim harass case disappear addit two thousand youth student worker woman child sacrif live mass upris julyaugust thousand injur maim letter sai start great liber war bnp alwai work welfar peopl leader activ partner everi struggl restor democraci human right end bnp support interim governmentern lead prof yunu take governmentern state accord constitut deliv benefit julyaugust studentsworkerspeopl upris countryman creat sustain platform fulfil aspir assur full cooper continu cooper bnp express hope peopl longstand expect prof yunu interim governmentern lead quickli bring fascist parti parti governmentern associ law prosecut crime peopl human prosecut corrupt loot return launder monei ensur compens proper medic treatment dead injur contain commod price improv law order return state power peopl free fair imparti nation parliamentari elect bnp believ chang reform constitut law rule institut essenti hold free imparti elect regard will support initi governmentern nativeclick ad letter bnp term theori develop first democraci late reform first democraci late wrong believ develop possibl strengthen implement democrat system reform state system law polici necessari bnp claim almost epochmak reform histori country’ polit economi come hand mention point reform programm shahe presid ziaur rahman vision country’ leader begum khaleda zia point reform programm act chairman tariqu rahman repair state structur point reform programm announc opinion parti bnp say ongo process reform part declar welcom reason discuss howev support strategi depriv peopl vote right wast time interest parti group concern bnp early convei concern suggest chief advis novemb last year februari year state discuss hold issu addit bnp believ governmentern activ hamper fact offici discrimin fascist governmentern promot post demand immedi post letter bnp emphas coordin statement state chief execut governmentern say recent except worri want confid chief advis feel statement individu support governmentern creat confus call necessari action regard bnp say great respons restor democrat right peopl entrust chief advis hope will fulfil soon possibl bnp call immedi announc specif elector roadmap view hold nation elect decemb also propos place nid project elect commiss quickli resolv legal complic redelimit constitu time bnp demand speedi trial involv fascist parti governmentern compens proper treatment kill injur julyaugust upris improv commod price law order withdraw fals harass case file fascist regim end letter mirza fakhrul islam alamgir urg chief advis quickli complet necessari reform end confus creat public mind announc specif roadmap nation elect next decemb"

From the deposited money, they later, fixed Taka 200 crore and transferred the rest Taka 800 crore to the accounts of different institutions and Beximco Engineering Limited under the Beximco Group. They also laundered the money through suspected transactions by transferring and enchasing it by defying banking rules, the IO said, adding that the accused persons violated section 409/420/467/468/471/477(ka) and 109 of Bangladesh Penal Code, section 5(2) of Corruption Prevention Act-1947 and section 4 of the Anti-Money Laundering Act-2018.

"science-technology","https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111728","Climate change threatens to destabilize the global economy","17/04/2025","Climate change is not just an environmental problem it affects financial stability through reduced income and property damage. Climate risk can certainly pose financial risks. But specifics matter and it is important to be clear about its magnitude, likelihood and timeframe. It reduces GDP, weakens economy. It also poses significant risks to financial institutions, leading to increased non-performing loans and reduced profits. Climate-related risks may manifest over varying time horizons, and are likely to intensify over time, especially if the global economy undergoes a disorderly transition. They can drive financial risks, such as credit, market, insurance, and liquidity risks. Economic models vastly underestimate the potential financial loss from climate change and the global economy could face a loss in GDP of at least 50% between 2070 and 2090 if nothing is done to curb emissions, a new report has found. Climate experts say that since the world is urgently trying to curb climate change, it is important to recognize the need for resilience against climate change while maintaining financial stability. The impacts of climate change have already begun to appear in various countries, and nations are taking steps to mitigate and adapt to these effects. Record-breaking heatwaves, devastating floods, and excessive rainfall are pushing global climate change into a dire situation. The environmental destruction caused by chasing economic growth is projected to reduce global income by 19 percent over the next 26 years. Environmental scientists’ research warns that without urgent action, the world could face financial losses ranging from $19 trillion to $59 trillion by 2050. New research from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research reveals that climate change will severely damage the global economy over the next 25 to 26 years. Developed, developing, and underdeveloped countries alike will suffer losses. Income will decline in North America and Europe, while South Asia and Africa will pay a particularly high price, despite their relatively small contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. The report also highlights the severe losses expected in the United States and the European Union. Since the Industrial Revolution, global temperatures have risen by more than 1 degree Celsius due to greenhouse gas emissions. Six years ago, the heads of two central banks issued a stern warning about the financial risks of climate change. Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, and François Villeroy de Galhau, ex-Governor of the Bank of France, issued an open letter sounding the alarm about the global economy. The letter warned that any company or industry failing to adapt to this new world would cease to exist. The letter was signed by the head of the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), a coalition of 34 central banks formed in 2017, of which the Bank of England is a founding member. NativeClick Ads In the letter released on behalf of the Bank of England, Carney and Villeroy de Galhau describe the “catastrophic impacts of climate change.” They note that the effects of climate change are already being felt worldwide, such as heatwaves in North America, storms in Southeast Asia, and droughts in Africa and Australia. These natural disasters are causing extensive damage to infrastructure and personal property, negatively impacting health, reducing productivity, and destroying assets. According to the European Economic Forum, in the coming days, climate change will undermine economic stability worldwide. Recent surveys and studies have expressed this concern. Over the next few decades, economic growth is expected to slow down in most countries around the world. A report by the human rights organization DARA, conducted some time ago on the impact of climate change on the people and economies of 184 countries, stated that by 2030, global economic growth could decline by 3.2 percent of GDP due to climate change. Recent surveys and research from various institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), paint a worrying picture of the economic damage expected from the negative effects of climate change in the coming years. A May 2019 report by The Economic Times warned that countries like the United States will face severe crises due to climate change. Without timely and adequate action, the U.S. economy could suffer losses of at least 10 percent due to its impacts. The report highlighted concerns such as crop failures in the Midwest, devastating wildfires in California, and infrastructure damage in the southern regions. It further noted that if this trend continues, the U.S. economy’s export and supply balance could be disrupted to a degree unseen since the 1980s. In 2018, scientists at Stanford University published a research report on the economic losses caused by climate change. According to their findings, if all countries worldwide manage to limit temperature increases to 2.5 degrees Celsius as per the Paris Climate Agreement, the global GDP would decline by 15 percent. However, if temperatures rise by 3 degrees Celsius, GDP losses could reach 25 percent. If no action is taken, temperatures could increase by 4 degrees Celsius by 2100, resulting in a 30 percent reduction in GDP compared to 2010 levels. The IMF has also expressed concerns that climate change could have a negative impact on the global economy over the next decade. The IMF report highlights that small island nations and coastal countries could lose up to 10 percent of their total economic growth due to climate change. In the context of the Paris Agreement, the IMF has warned of the potential negative effects of climate change on the global economy. According to IMF sources, nearly 80 percent of least developed countries and 50 percent of developing countries are at extreme risk from climate change. In this regard, in addition to Bangladesh, the economies of coastal Cambodia, China, Egypt, Guyana, Suriname, Thailand, and Vietnam will also face significant damage. Furthermore, if temperatures continue to rise, sectors related to agriculture, forestry, coastal housing, and tourism worldwide will suffer extensive harm. Moreover, nearly half of South Asia’s regions face the risk of declining economic growth over the next few decades. The World Bank report states that changes in temperature and rainfall patterns in this region will cause significant economic losses. The World Bank conducted a study assessing the economic impacts of climate change in South Asian countries, including India, and identifying which areas are most vulnerable by 2050. The report reveals that over 800 million people currently live in severe climate hotspots. Among South Asian countries, Bangladeshis living in these critical hotspots will be the most economically affected in terms of per capita GDP due to changes in average weather conditions. It further states that by 2050, their income could decline by 14.4 percent. In comparison, incomes in India and Sri Lanka are projected to decrease by 9.8 percent and 10.1 percent, respectively. According to a World Bank economist, there is a link between climate hotspots and water-scarce areas, putting 600 million Indians at risk of severe water shortages due to climate-related damages. Additionally, changes in the timing and amount of rainfall will adversely affect agricultural production over the next decades. All these factors combined will thrust the region’s economy into a severe crisis. Economic threats in South Asia become acute The primary reason for the economic threats in various South Asian countries lies largely in their dependence on geographic location, infrastructural activities, and natural resources of their economies. This reliance continuously disrupts the process of socio-economic development and economic progress. Although the economies of India and Bangladesh have moved from agriculture to production-oriented industries, a significant portion of their economies is still tied to the agricultural sector. Both countries’ economies remain heavily dependent on agriculture. In Bangladesh, agriculture is the largest employment sector. According to the 2018 economic survey of Bangladesh, it provides 40.6% of the labor force and contributes 14.10% to the national GDP. This sector's role in creating employment, poverty alleviation, human resource development, and food security in the national economy is undeniable. However, climate change is adversely affecting agriculture, the backbone of the country’s economy. Additionally, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), in its report on climate and economics, states that by the end of this century, Bangladesh’s economic growth could face a loss of 9.4%. The report forecasts the financial impact of climate change on six countries, including Bangladesh. Maldives and Nepal are the most vulnerable economically, with anticipated losses of 12.6% and 9.9%, respectively, by the century's end. Bangladesh’s loss is projected at 9.4%, close to Nepal’s figure. India is expected to face an 8.7% economic loss, Bhutan 6.6%, and Sri Lanka 6.5%. The report further notes that to combat climate change, South Asia must spend at least $73 billion annually starting now. Climate change poses a threat not only to the global economy but to all humanity. Despite various initiatives by different countries, global consensus remains elusive. Excessive carbon dioxide has already accumulated in the atmosphere if this is not curbed, what will be our future? However, there is hope as global awareness of climate change is increasing. Some countries are imposing carbon taxes to reduce emissions. China, Denmark, Germany, and Sweden have imposed carbon taxes on the meat, dairy, and poultry industries. Many countries are reducing fossil fuel use and increasing renewable energy consumption. Forest areas are expanding. According to the 2015 agreement, 195 countries have signed pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28% by 2025. Yet, if the earth’s temperature rises by 2 degrees Celsius compared to the pre-industrial era, no further measures will be able to halt climate change. In other words, if we fail to tackle climate change, nearly all countries’ economies will plunge into severe crisis, and ultimately, we will suffer the consequences. Among the sectors directly negatively affected by climate change in Bangladesh’s economy, agriculture stands foremost. Its productivity entirely depends on temperature, rainfall, intensity, weather conditions, and seasonal variations. Key crops include food grains, rice, jute, wheat, tea, and mangoes. Rice is Bangladesh’s main crop. In 2005-06, production was 28.8 million tons. Bangladesh is the world’s fourth-largest rice producer. Despite rice and jute being the main crops, wheat has greater overall importance. However, climate change has adversely impacted this sector. According to agricultural information services, rising temperatures are causing a steady decline in rice production. Rice cultivation requires temperatures between 18–35 degrees Celsius. During winter, temperatures often drop well below 18 degrees, and during summer, they rise above 35 degrees. This causes difficulties in rice pollination and reduces yield. Rising temperatures cause polar ice to melt, increasing sea levels. Soil salinity in coastal agricultural lands is rising, further reducing crop production day by day. Researchers warn that if soil salinity continues to increase, agricultural income will drop by 21% annually, and 40% of coastal farmland will be at risk. This threatens the livelihoods of approximately 240,000 farmers. Besides rice, production of other crops such as jute, wheat, maize, peas, and chickpeas is also declining due to hailstorms, storms, sudden floods, and other extreme weather events. Per capita income is decreasing as a result. Moreover, excessive cold spells in the Rabi season severely damage crop yields. A significant portion of Bangladesh’s economy depends on fishery resources. Employment, foreign exchange, and even the healthcare sector rely heavily on it. Bangladesh has nearly 147,000 hectares of ponds, 5,488 hectares of baor (oxbow lakes), and 11 million hectares of shrimp farms. Additionally, about 4.47 million hectares of open water bodies (rivers, haors, beels, canals) are home to 250 fish species, including 24 species that breed there. This vast fishery resource is now threatened by climate change. Damage to this resource would severely impact the country’s economy. According to a research report by the international organization Germanwatch, climate change causes Bangladesh an annual loss of $2.189 billion, negatively affecting national growth by 1.81%. The report states that from 1990 to 2009, nearly 20% of the world’s climate-related losses occurred in Bangladesh. Moreover, with decreasing arable land and diminishing fishery and forest resources, Bangladesh’s main revenue sources are at risk. Reduced agriculture-based production will cause the government to lose a substantial portion of its revenue and export income. In such conditions, Bangladesh’s economy will struggle, with expenditure exceeding income. At the national level, Bangladesh faces enormous financial losses due to the need to combat climate change. Implementing the Bay of Bengal Island Plan, a technology- and science-based techno-economic mega-plan, will require about 2.5% of GDP by 2025. To prevent and manage various natural disasters, infrastructural designs must be modified and upgraded. For example, to prevent saline water intrusion, coastal polders need redesigning, repair, and new construction irrigation projects require reform due to changes in river flow and behavior. Moreover, significant budget allocations are required annually to repair or rebuild infrastructure damaged by successive natural disasters. If donor agencies refuse to fund these expenses, the Bangladesh government must cover them from internal revenue, causing fiscal deficits in the domestic market and hindering other vital development projects. According to the IMF, about 80% of least developed countries and 50% of developing countries face extreme climate change risks. Besides Bangladesh, the economies of coastal Cambodia, China, Egypt, Guyana, Suriname, Thailand, and Vietnam will also suffer losses. If temperatures continue to rise, agriculture, forestry, coastal housing, and tourism sectors worldwide will be severely affected. Additionally, nearly half of South Asia’s regions face risks of declining economic growth in the coming decades. Economically, Maldives and Nepal are the most vulnerable, with projected losses of 12.6% and 9.9%, respectively, by century’s end. Bangladesh’s projected loss is 9.4%, close to Nepal’s. What Experts Are Saying in This Situation Dr. A. K. M. Mahmudul Haque, Professor in the Political Science Department at Rajshahi University, states that it is estimated that climate change causes an annual loss of $1.7 trillion. This loss is feared to rise to $3.1 trillion by 2050. These figures are based on research that considers damage to assets, infrastructure, human health, and the agricultural sector. He notes that a study conducted on 163 disasters from 2001 to 2019 attributes the majority of these losses to relatively poor countries. One might then ask: what would have happened if Bangladesh had not suffered from the negative impacts of climate change? Would the country’s economy have shown any positive effects? To answer this, one must understand the nature of climate change in Bangladesh. The area of arable land is also declining at an alarming rate due to climate change. Dr. Haque explains that beyond its direct economic impacts, climate change has many indirect effects. For example, affected populations lose their livelihoods and migrate to large cities, creating overcrowding. It is estimated that by 2050, the number of internal climate migrants in Bangladesh will exceed 20 million. This rapid population growth in cities leads to severe problems such as traffic congestion. Moreover, if these migrants were able to sustain their livelihoods in their own regions, a sustainable flow would be maintained in Bangladesh’s overall GDP. Measuring how much an individual marginal farmer is affected by climate change in Bangladesh is quite difficult. In this situation, relying solely on international donor agencies to resolve the problem is not practical. Instead, strengthening domestic policies—such as developing indigenous technology, expertise, resilience, climate migration management, state initiatives to send and support migrant workers abroad—and ensuring their implementation may be the most effective way forward. Rafid Bin Islam, a young environmental activist and student of the Department of Mass Communication and Journalism at Dhaka University, says the effects of global warming are not only environmental but deeply intertwined with a country’s economy, posing a huge threat to development and prosperity. Labor productivity is declining, while healthcare costs are rising. Other economic sectors are also particularly vulnerable. Climate change plays a direct or indirect role in various issues, including reduced availability of raw materials for industries and shortages of skilled labor. For instance, inland waterway transportation is disrupted during the dry season, which is one of the main modes of transporting goods within the country. This not only poses a major threat to trade activities but also gradually reduces the popularity of waterway communication systems. He also said, the government must take well-regulated measures to reduce the damage caused by climate change. Western countries are already focusing on reducing carbon emissions. The Bangladesh government has expressed its commitment to climate change policies through initiatives like the National Adaptation Program of Action and the Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan. Rafid also said, to tackle this global challenge, the government must prioritize climate change on its agenda. In addition to taking state-level actions, the scope of the United Nations and other organizations must be expanded. By actively addressing climate change, Bangladesh can not only safeguard its increasingly promising economic future but also meet the challenge of protecting the livelihoods of millions of its citizens.

Those who are accompanying the Chief Adviser are: footballers Afida Khandaker and Shaheda Akhter Ripa and cricketers Sumaiya Akhter and Sharmin Sultana. This is the first time that a group of female athletes is going to accompany the head of government on a state visit. The players, who will accompany the Chief Adviser, called on him at the State Guest House Jamuna on Thursday evening. Qatar Foundation has invited these female athletes to accompany Chief Adviser Prof Yunus to Qatar. During the meeting, the four athletes expressed their enthusiasm at receiving the invitation to accompany the Chief Adviser on a state visit. They said they are very happy to receive the invitation for this tour and their teammates are also excited about their invitation. The women footballers said they do not get enough opportunities to play matches with other teams in Asia outside the South Asia. “We want to invite the Qatar women's team to play a friendly match with us. During this tour, we want to visit their sports facilities. We want to know their professional thoughts,” they said. NativeClick Ads Cricket is not so popular in Qatar, the women cricketers said, adding that they will try to create interest in cricket among the Qatar people during this tour. “We will highlight the stories of our men's and women's cricket teams. We will prepare a presentation and carry it (to Qatar),” they told Prof Yunus. The four female athletes informed the Chief Adviser of their life struggles at the meeting and thanked the Chief Adviser for giving them the opportunity to go on a state visit with him. After listening to their life experiences and plans for the Qatar tour, Prof Yunus expressed great encouragement and support. “I want you present the true tales of your life to them.

Chief Adviser Professor Dr. Muhammad Yunus said, “We missed each other for a long time because our relations were frozen. We need to overcome that hurdles.” The Chief Adviser made the comment when Pakistani Foreign Secretary Amna Baloch called on him at the State Guest Jamuna on Thursday. Acknowledging past issues, Baloch said Bangladesh and Pakistan must find ways to “harness the potential between the two countries.” “We have a huge intra-market potential on our own rights, and we should use it,” Baloch said. “We can't miss the bus every time.” She said there is the need for regular business-to-business (B2B) interactions between the private sectors of two countries and exchanging visits at all levels. In January 2025, a delegation of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FPCCI) visited Bangladesh and signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce & Industries (FBCCI).

"science-technology","https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111748","There are examples of turning ex-enemies into allies ","18/04/2025","Claiming that the interim government has taken a pro-Bangladesh foreign policy, Chief Adviser's Deputy Press Secretary Abul Kalam Azad Majumder has said there are examples of turning former enemies into allies in the world. “There are many instances of former enemies turning into allies,” he wrote in a post on his verified Facebook account on Friday. Citing examples, he mentioned that France and England fought countless wars for centuries, but joined hands in the Second World War. The US bombed Japan in the same war, but later turned the country into an ally, Azad said. He added: “The other day, we faced a question about whether Bangladesh is shifting its foreign policy to be pro-Pakistan. It did not surprise us at all.” There will always be some people who will rarely believe in Bangladesh’s independent identity, he said. “Our response was obvious. Irrespective of whatever happened in the past with regard to the country’s foreign policy, it will be a pro-Bangladesh policy from now on, driven by our own interest,” the deputy press secretary said. Distancing from one neighbour to keep another happy cannot be the foreign policy of an independent nation, he added. NativeClick Ads He said it took the interim government less than 24 hours to translate its words into action by reminding Amna Baloch, the visiting foreign secretary of Pakistan, the outstanding issues between the two countries, while at the same time agreeing to work together for mutual benefits. One of the emotive issues, of course hindering Bangladesh-Pakistan relations, is Bangladesh’s demand for an apology from Pakistan for the genocide and atrocities committed by its armed forces in 1971, Azad said. He said even many in Pakistan’s civil society, media, and intelligentsia believed that an apology would be an act of goodwill and grace, but the Pakistan’s Foreign Office and military bureaucracy were always opposed to such an idea, and thus a formal apology never came. Bangladesh also pressed for the issue of division of assets, which was a forgotten matter for the past regimes, who preferred disengagement to talks, the deputy press secretary said. According to an estimate, he said, Bangladesh has a claim of at least US$ 4.32 billion as of 1974. The estimate was based on assumptions with respect to internal capital creation, external debt settlement, and retention of external financial assets, he mentioned. He said Bangladesh has an additional claim of about US$ 200 million, which was donated by foreign countries/agencies for the cyclone victims of the then East Pakistan in November 1970. “The money was lying in the office of the State Bank of Pakistan in Dhaka before it was transferred to the Lahore Branch of the State Bank of Pakistan during our war of liberation in 1971,” Azad said. He said the repatriation of stranded Pakistanis was another issue that hindered the relationship between the two countries. In the past, he said, Pakistan only took back around 125,000 of its people, but some 325,000 are housed in 79 camps in 14 districts of Bangladesh. Azad said these are the issues that continued to remain as barriers in order to move towards a healthy and forward-looking bilateral relationship between the two countries. “And the best option to resolve the issues is obviously talks, and this is exactly what the interim government is trying to do”. “It has brought Pakistan to talks after long years and duly raised the issues while at the same time looking to explore trade and commerce potential for mutual benefits,” he wrote in his post. The deputy press secretary reminded that Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus, during his meeting with his counterpart Shehbaz Sharif in Egypt earlier this year, spoke about the need for resolving the outstanding issues, and on Thursday, while holding a meeting with Baloch at the State Guest House Jamuna, he reiterated his call. But, in the same meeting, Prof Yunus insisted on a sound relationship with neighbouring countries, including Pakistan, to tap the huge economic potential of the region, he said. “It is perhaps time for Bangladesh and Pakistan to move on and work together to resolve the past issues for future benefits,” Azad said.","exampl turn exenemi alli","claim interim governmentern take probangladesh foreign polici chief advis deputi press secretari abul kalam azad majumd say exampl turn former enemi alli world mani instanc former enemi turn alli write post verifi facebook account fridai cite exampl mention franc england fight countless war centuri join hand 2 world war u bomb japan war late turn countri alli azad say ad dai face question whether bangladesh shift foreign polici propakistan surpris u will alwai peopl will rare believ bangladesh’ independ ident say respons obviou irrespect whatev happen past regard country’ foreign polici will probangladesh polici now drive interest deputi press secretari say distanc on neighbour keep anoth happi foreign polici independ nation ad nativeclick ad say take interim governmentern little hour translat word action remind amna baloch visit foreign secretari pakistan outstand issu two countri time agre work togeth mutual benefit on emot issu cours hinder bangladeshpakistan relat bangladesh’ demand apologi pakistan genocid atroc commit arm forc azad say say even mani pakistan’ civil societi medium intelligentsia believ apologi act goodwil grace pakistan’ foreign offic militari bureaucraci alwai oppos idea thu formal apologi never come bangladesh also press issu divis asset forget matter past regim prefer disengag talk deputi press secretari say accord estim say bangladesh claim less u billion estim base assumpt respect intern capit creation extern debt settlement retent extern financi asset mention say bangladesh addit claim u million donat foreign countriesag cyclon victim east pakistan novemb monei ly offic state bank pakistan dhaka transfer lahor branch state bank pakistan war liber azad say say repatri strand pakistani anoth issu hinder relationship two countri past say pakistan take back around peopl hous camp district bangladesh azad say issu continu remain barrier order move toward healthi forwardlook bilater relationship two countri good option resolv issu obvious talk exactli interim governmentern try bring pakistan talk long year duli rais issu time look explor trade commerc potenti mutual benefit write post deputi press secretari remind chief advis professor muhammad yunu meet counterpart shehbaz sharif egypt early year speak need resolv outstand issu thursdai hold meet baloch state guest hous jamuna reiter call meet prof yunu insist sound relationship neighbour countri includ pakistan tap huge econom potenti region say perhap time bangladesh pakistan move work togeth resolv past issu futur benefit azad say"

"science-technology","https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111751","Govt to increase manpower at Bangladesh missions: Foreign Adviser","18/04/2025","Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain has said the government is actively working to increase manpower in Bangladesh’s missions abroad, particularly at consulate general offices, to ensure better services for millions of expatriates. The adviser said this while addressing a discussion marking Foreign Service Day-2025 at the Foreign Service Academy in the capital on Friday. “We have initiated efforts to enhance human resources, especially at our consular posts . . . I hope to achieve at least partial success in this endeavor,” he said. Hossain said around 80 percent of the challenges faced by Bangladeshi expatriate workers stem from domestic processes before their migration, while the remaining 20 percent occur in destination countries. “Yet, our missions abroad are left to deal with the entire 100 percent of the problems,” he observed, stressing the importance of addressing root causes at home to ease pressure on foreign missions. Despite limited manpower and logistical constraints, Bangladesh missions are providing services to over 10 million expatriates worldwide, he said. Citing the example of Saudi Arabia, the adviser said nearly 3.2 million Bangladeshis reside in the Kingdom. “How can 50 officials in a mission handle problems of such a vast number?,” he questioned. He urged that initiatives must begin in Dhaka to reduce the systemic difficulties facing migrant workers before they even leave the country. NativeClick Ads Calling for greater empathy among officials, the foreign adviser said, “Expatriates don’t go to missions out of choice. Most arrive in desperation. While a few may behave improperly, the majority come in dire need of support.” He urged officials at missions abroad to serve expatriates with utmost sincerity and dedication, recognising their significant contributions to the nation’s economy. Speaking to reporters after the event, the foreign adviser also addressed the Rohingya repatriation crisis, describing Bangladesh’s current position as a “dilemma.” He identified the Arakan Army, the rebel group who is now controlling most of the area of Myanmar’s Rakhine state, as a major impediment to progress. “The Arakan Army is neither a state actor nor an internationally recognised entity, so formal talks are not possible. Yet, a solution to the crisis is unlikely without engaging them in some form,” he said. Hossain stressed that despite the lack of recognition, the Arakan Army’s presence and influence in Rakhine make their role unavoidable in any comprehensive resolution to the Rohingya crisis. Foreign Secretary Md Jashim Uddin and several former Bangladesh diplomats also spoke at the discussion on different features of the day. Foreign Service Day is observed on April 18 each year, commemorating a pivotal moment during Bangladesh’s Liberation War in 1971 when a group of brave Bengali diplomats serving in the Pakistan Foreign Service first pledged their allegiance to the Provisional Government of Bangladesh. Their bold move marked a significant milestone in the nation's journey toward independence and laid the foundation for an independent foreign policy. The day symbolizes the courage, commitment, and professional excellence of Bangladesh’s diplomatic community in advancing the country’s interests on the global stage.","govt increas manpow bangladesh mission foreign advis","foreign affair advis md touhid hossain say governmentern activ work increas manpow bangladesh’ mission abroad particularli consul gener offic ensur good servic million expatri advis say address discuss mark foreign servic dai foreign servic academi capit fridai initi effort enhanc human resourc especi consular post hope achiev less partial success endeavor say hossain say around percent challeng face bangladeshi expatri worker stem domest process migrat remain percent occur destin countri yet mission abroad leave deal entir percent problem observ stress import address root caus home eas pressur foreign mission despit limit manpow logist constraint bangladesh mission provid servic million expatri worldwid say cite exampl saudi arabia advis say nearli million bangladeshi resid kingdom can offici mission handl problem vast numb question urg initi must begin dhaka reduc system difficulti face migrant worker even leav countri nativeclick ad call great empathi among offici foreign advis say expatri don’t go mission choic arriv desper mai behav improperli major come dire need support urg offici mission abroad serv expatri utmost sincer dedic recognis signific contribut nation’ economi speak report event foreign advis also address rohingya repatri crisi describ bangladesh’ current posit dilemma identifi arakan armi rebel group now control area myanmar’ rakhin state major impedi progress arakan armi neither state actor internation recognis entiti formal talk possibl yet solut crisi unlik without engag form say hossain stress despit lack recognit arakan army’ presenc influenc rakhin make role unavoid comprehens resolut rohingya crisi foreign secretari md jashim uddin sever former bangladesh diplomat also speak discuss differ featur dai foreign servic dai observ april year commemor pivot moment bangladesh’ liber war group brave bengali diplomat serv pakistan foreign servic first pledg allegi provision govern bangladesh bold move mark signific mileston nation journei toward independ lay foundat independ foreign polici dai symbol courag commit profession excel bangladesh’ diplomat commun advanc country’ interest global stage"

In a statement, the agency warned that “humanitarian aid and supplies have not entered the Gaza Strip since 2 March 2025, when the Israeli Authorities imposed a siege.” “This is already three times longer than the one enforced in October 2023 when the war started,” it added. It noted that there are “at least 20 displacement orders issued by the Israeli military between 18 March and 14 April, in total,” resulting in “about 69% of the Gaza Strip is under active displacement orders, within the ‘no-go’ zone or both.” The agency estimated that “nearly 420,000 people have been displaced yet again since the breakdown of the ceasefire.” It also said that “resumed bombardments and the total restriction on aid are severely hampering humanitarian agencies’ ability to respond to urgent needs—especially food, clean water, sanitation, shelter, and medical supplies.” Israel resumed its attacks in Gaza on March 18, shattering a two-month truce.

The event was hosted online by an international peace NGO, Heavenly Culture, World Peace, Restoration of Light (HWPL), with around 200 participants joining from 50 countries. Under the theme of Transforming Conflict through AI and Cultural Understanding, a key focus of the workshop was the growing impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on journalism. Discussions explored how journalists can responsibly integrate new technologies while upholding essential values such as accuracy, fairness, and empathy. The event also featured discussions centered on the recent publication, Peace Journalism Studies (2024). The journal highlights peace journalism’s potential to foster reconciliation and cross-cultural understanding, especially in regions affected by conflict. Case studies demonstrate how constructive reporting can help bridge divides and support long-term peacebuilding. In a congratulatory message, Mr. Berry Lwando, Director General of the Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation, remarked, “In today’s fast-paced media landscape, what we choose to highlight matters. Peace journalism isn’t about ignoring conflict—it’s about framing it in ways that invite dialogue, not division. That’s a responsibility we carry.” Hon. Noel Lipipa, Member of Malawian Parliament for Blantyre City South Constituency, also delivered his congratulatory message. “I’m inspired by the work being done to explore how AI and cultural understanding can help reshape how we tell stories and resolve conflict. The world needs more storytellers committed to peace.” In his article, Director of News, Sports and Current Affairs / ABS TV Radio in Antigua and Barbuda, Mr. Garfield Burford, underscores the importance of evidence-based reporting to counter misinformation. While AI can make journalism more efficient, he cautions that it also raises concerns about accuracy and trust. He emphasizes that ethical judgment and human empathy remain essential to the work of a journalist. Mr. Sijam Sinjali, CEO of Agleshwori Hills Development Trust in Nepal, discusses the role of peace journalism in encouraging non-violent conflict resolution. His essay explores the challenges and ethical responsibilities peace journalists face, and how technology may help support more informed, solution-oriented reporting. NativeClick Ads From the Philippines, Dr. Musa Damao, Executive Director of Bangsamoro Dialogue for Peace and Justice, Inc., highlights how peace journalism supports the Bangsamoro peace process. He advocates for integrating peace education into school curricula and highlights how morally grounded journalism can contribute to lasting peace and development. CEO of Varna Institute for Peace Research in Austria, Mr. Josef Mühlbauer, explores how open dialogue and debate can help challenge harmful narratives. He references the “Varna Peace Institute” podcast as a platform where open discussions help uncover root causes of conflict and promote understanding. In her contribution, Ms. Tuty Purwaningsih, Director of Media Desa in Indonesia, looks at how families and communities teach values like tolerance and empathy, and how the media can amplify these efforts by focusing on constructive stories. The workshop also aligned with HWPL’s broader peace initiatives, particularly the Declaration of Peace and Cessation of War (DPCW). Article 10 of the DPCW, “Spreading a Culture of Peace,” emphasizes the role of media in promoting harmony through responsible communication. HWPL continues to advocate for journalism that contributes to a more peaceful and inclusive society. The event concluded with a call for stronger collaboration among journalists, academics, and peacebuilders, reaffirming a shared commitment to ethical and thoughtful journalism in a rapidly evolving media environment.","peac journal digit ag hwpl explor ethic ai global cooper","hwpl intern workshop peac journal studi hold april bring togeth journalist scholar peac practition explor peac journal can help address global challeng misinform conflict era rapid digit transform event host onlin intern peac ngo heavenli cultur world peac restor light hwpl around particip join countri theme transform conflict ai cultur understand kei focu workshop grow impact artifici intellig ai journal discuss explor journalist can responsibli integr new technologi uphold essenti valu accuraci fair empathi event also featur discuss center recent public peac journal studi journal highlight peac journalism’ potenti foster reconcili crosscultur understand especi region affect conflict case studi demonstr construct report can help bridg divid support longterm peacebuild congratulatori messag mr berri lwando director gener zambia nation broadcast corpor remark today’ fastpac medium landscap choos highlight matter peac journal isn’t ignor conflict it’ frame wai invit dialogu divis that’ respons carri hon noel lipipa member malawian parliament blantyr citi south constitu also deliv congratulatori messag i’m inspir work do explor ai cultur understand can help reshap tell stori resolv conflict world need storytel commit peac articl director new sport current affair ab tv radio antigua barbuda mr garfield burford underscor import evidencebas report counter misinform ai can make journal effici caution also rais concern accuraci trust emphas ethic judgment human empathi remain essenti work journalist mr sijam sinjali ceo agleshwori hill develop trust nepal discuss role peac journal encourag nonviol conflict resolut essai explor challeng ethic respons peac journalist face technologi mai help support inform solutionori report nativeclick ad philippin dr musa damao execut director bangsamoro dialogu peac justic inc highlight peac journal support bangsamoro peac process advoc integr peac educ school curriculum highlight moral grind journal can contribut last peac develop ceo varna institut peac research austria mr josef mühlbauer explor open dialogu debat can help challeng harm narr refer varna peac institut podcast platform open discuss help uncov root caus conflict promot understand contribut be tuti purwaningsih director medium desa indonesia look famili commun teach valu like toler empathi medium can amplifi effort focus construct stori workshop also align hwpl’ broad peac initi particularli declar peac cessat war dpcw articl dpcw spread cultur peac emphas role medium promot harmoni respons commun hwpl continu advoc journal contribut peac inclus societi event conclud call strong collabor among journalist academ peacebuild reaffirm share commit ethic think journal rapidli evolv medium environ"

"science-technology","https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111775","Thousands join anti-Trump protests across US","20/04/2025","Thousands took to the streets across the US on Saturday to protest over recent actions by President Donald Trump, the BBC reported. Known as ""50501"", for ""50 protests, 50 states, 1 movement"", the demonstrations were intended to coincide with the 250th anniversary of the start of the American Revolutionary War. From outside the White House and Tesla dealerships and at the centres of many cities, protesters expressed a variety of grievances. Many called for the return of Kilmar Ábrego García, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Political protests are becoming more common in the US - the ""Hands Off"" demonstrations in early April drew tens of thousands in cities across the country. The most recent polling from Gallup suggests 45% of voters approve of Trump's performance in the first quarter of his term, which is more than the 41% who approved during the same period in his first administration. Still, it is lower than the average first-quarter rating of 60% for all presidents elected between 1952 and 2020. Saturday's protests addressed a number of Trump actions, including those by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) - Trump's initiative to cut US government jobs and other spending - and the administration's unwillingness to bring about the return of Ábrego García, a citizen of El Salvador. Gihad Elgendy told CNN he joined the protest at the White House to criticise the deportation of Ábrego García. He believes Trump ""could easily pressure El Salvador to bring him back"". NativeClick Ads The protests were generally reported as peaceful, although Representative Suhas Subramanyam, a Democrat, posted a video on X of a man holding a Trump sign and pushing through a crowd to angrily confront him. Many demonstrators carried signs reading ""No Kings,"" a nod to the anniversary of the start of the country's revolution against English rule. During celebrations of the anniversary in Massachusetts that commemorated the battles of Lexington and Concord and the famous horse ride of Paul Revere, people held similar signs. There was also a 50501 demonstration in Boston on Saturday. ""This is a very perilous time in America for liberty,"" Thomas Bassford, told the Associated Press, while in Boston with his partner, daughter and two grandsons. ""I wanted the boys to learn about the origins of this country and that sometimes we have to fight for freedom."" Trump's popularity appears to be edging down, especially when it comes to the economy. When he took office in January, his approval rating was 47%, according to Gallup. His approval rating in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll similarly dipped to 43% from 47% on Inauguration Day.

They also highlighted ongoing support in establishing a specialised burn unit in Chattogram. The Chinese Ambassador informed that progress is being made to launch a direct Kunming–Chittagong flight, and efforts are underway to expedite medical visas for Bangladeshi patients. Prof Yunus stressed the importance of cultural exchange, proposing the establishment of a Chinese Cultural Centre and Language Institute to allow young Bangladeshis to engage more closely with Chinese language and culture. Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to launching a long-term, 50-year master plan on water management, including work on the Teesta River system. The Chief Adviser also raised the possibility of expanding jute exports to China and urged greater Chinese investment in the locomotive sector. He proposed setting up locomotive manufacturing and maintenance hubs in both Chattogram and Syedpur, alongside capacity-building workshops and training programmes. Agricultural trade was another area of progress. Bangladesh will begin exporting mangoes to China this season, with jackfruit exports scheduled for next year. “I’ll send a basket of fresh mangoes to President Xi myself,” said Chief Adviser Prof Yunus.

According to Houthi-run al-Masirah TV, the airstrikes targeted the Farwah market in the Shu’ub neighborhood, one of the busiest markets in Sanaa. Rescue operations are ongoing, with teams searching for survivors and victims beneath the rubble. The strikes were part of a broader wave of U.S. airstrikes that hit multiple locations in and around Sanaa on Sunday, the Houthi media outlet added. The incident came days after the deadly U.S. airstrikes on the Ras Isa fuel port in western Yemen late Thursday night that killed 80 people, wounded 170 others, and caused widespread damage to fuel storage infrastructure, leading to fuel spills into the Red Sea, according to local Houthi health officials. Tensions between the Houthi group and the U.S. military have escalated since Washington resumed airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen on March 15 to deter the group from attacking Israel and U.S. warships in the Red Sea. The Houthis, which control much of northern Yemen, said their attacks aim to press U.S.-backed Israel to stop the offensive against the Gaza Strip and allow the entry of humanitarian aid into the Palestinian enclave.

Additionally, 20 to 30 unnamed individuals were also accused in the case. According to campus sources, the dispute began around 4 PM on Saturday when Parvez went to a nearby alley for snacks. There, three female students reportedly accused him of eve-teasing. The university administration attempted to mediate the matter and ease tensions. However, coming out of the proctor’s office, a group of outsiders attacked Parvez. He sustained critical injuries after being stabbed in the chest.

He was 88 years old, Al Jazeera reports. Born in Argentina, he was the first Latin American pope as well as the first non-European to serve for more than 1,000 years. He was known for his simple words and humble manner that immediately won over the crowds. After he assumed the papacy in 2013, Francis aimed to make the church more inclusive, opening up key roles to women and trying to address the issue of child sex abuse by Catholic clerics. Analysts, however, remain divided about the success of his efforts. The 88-year-old pontiff was recovering from double pneumonia and was under doctors’ orders to observe two months of convalescence since he left Rome’s Gemelli Hospital on March 23. Francis suffered from a number of health issues throughout his life, including having part of one of his lungs removed at the age of 21. He became increasingly fragile in recent years. World leaders are paying tribute, with French President Emmanuel Macron calling him a “man of humility” and the Dutch PM describing him as a “role model for Catholics and non-Catholics alike”. NativeClick Ads The Pope’s death comes fewer than 24 hours after he made an appearance at the Vatican’s St Peter’s Square for Easter Sunday.

Corruption, nepotism, mismanagement and plundering of the state wealth plagued the economy of Bangladesh during the last several years that will stage back under the prudent leadership of Bangladesh's interim government Nobel Peace Laureate Professor Dr. Muhammad Yunus, said Nuria Lopez. Nuria Lopez, a Spanish national who came to Bangladesh in the early 90s and set up the export –oriented garment industry in Gazipur, said the readymade garment industry (RMG) is the backbone of the economy generating some 4.00 million jobs directly and indirectly some 15 million jobs in the country. Bangladesh received its lowest net foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow in the past five years in 2024, as the country experienced political turmoil and economic instability. A sluggish inflow in the first half of the year, compounded by mass uprising, the subsequent departure of the Awami League government in August, and a volatile forex situation throughout the year, contributed by experts to a 13.25% year-on-year decrease in net FDI in 2024. According to central bank data, net FDI inflow amounted to $1.27 billion in 2024, significantly down from $1.46 billion a year ago. When asked why FDI declined in 2024, Mohammad Ali, managing director and chief executive officer of Pubali Bank, said that foreign investors lacked confidence in the year against the backdrop of sliding in the law and order situation of the country after the political changeover. He said, “We did not receive much foreign investment during the first six months of 2024. Then in July, following student-led mass protests, the government was overthrown in August and a new interim government took office”. “During that period, the country's law and order situation deteriorated, although conditions began to improve after December. Foreign investors generally lack confidence in such situations, which is the main reason why FDI in 2024 was lower compared to previous years.” Meanwhile, the interim government has a major task to ensure sound law and order situation as the past Awami League government transformed the country’s law enforcement agencies into ‘monsters’ over the last 15 years. The Bangladesh economy will suffer heavily provided the export-oriented garment industry, the largest earner of export earnings of the country, are being targeted by miscreants, said Nuria Lopez. Meanwhile, the Spanish entrepreneur has expressed his support to Bangladesh's interim government led by Nobel Peace Laureate Professor Dr. Muhammad Yunus. The interim government should ensure sound law and order situation and protect business establishments and businessmen to revive the economy, said leaders of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (JBCCI), International Chamber of Commerce, Bangladesh (ICCB), Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI) while talking to this correspondent. However, as the country is going through a transition period, smooth engagement and participation of the existing import and export houses in the country is also important to retain the economy on the right track. The economy of Bangladesh has suffered a massive blow during the student movement on quota system in the government job during the period of July, 2024. Managing Director of Zalo Knitting Ltd, Nuria Lopez said that the employment generation in the economy is important as some 20 lakh youths are entering the job market every year. The RMG is the labour intensive industry and the highly densely populated country like Bangladesh can’t sustain generating thousands of jobs. Urging the stakeholders concerned to extend cooperation to the Nobel laureate to carry out necessary reforms, the economy will require several years to overcome the loss centering movement and violence and laid emphasis on normalcy to run business. High economic disparity, corruption, nepotism, slow employment creation, Russia-Ukraine war, siphoning off state wealth out of the country by some corrupt persons have created a crisis in the economy, she said. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has praised Bangladesh's measures, taken by the interim government, to overcome economic challenges due to the recent turbulence and major floods. “In response to the challenging circumstances, the authorities' efforts to initiate adjustments, including continued monetary tightening and rationalizing non-priority capital spending are commendable,"" IMF Mission Chief for Bangladesh Chris Papageorgiou said. BIDA Executive Chairman Chowdhury Ashik Mahmud Bin Harun presented the business and investment potential of Bangladesh. Meanwhile, Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus recently urged the global investors to come up with their business in Bangladesh to change the world saying Bangladesh is the best place for investment. “Bangladesh is a country with crazy ideas to change the world...so we invite you to join that craft not only to change Bangladesh by your business but to change the world,” he said while addressing the inaugural session of Bangladesh Investment Summit-2025 at Hotel Intercontinental here. Prof Yunus said: “If you want to make a business with a purpose, along with the business we do, Bangladesh is the place."" Meanwhile, the recently concluded Bangladesh Investment Summit 2025 has yielded investment declaration worth Tk 3,100 crore, says Chowdhury Ashik Mahmud Bin Harun, executive chairman of the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA). He shared the information at a press conference at the Foreign Service Academy in the capital. The European Union Chamber of Commerce in Bangladesh (EuroCham) has laid emphasis on a collaborative and transparent approach to energy pricing reforms, voicing concerns over the recently proposed gas tariff structure by the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC). In a statement, EuroCham acknowledged the government's strides toward a sustainable energy future but warned that the differential tariff mechanism — based on industrial consumers' contractual timelines and gas connection status — could inadvertently hurt investor sentiment and industrial growth. According to the chamber, the newly-proposed model risks placing an unfair burden on new and expanding industries, which would face significantly higher gas tariffs than their long-established counterparts — despite operating within the same sector. “Fragmented energy costs across similar operations may erode Bangladesh's competitive edge and discourage both foreign and domestic investment,” said EuroCham, pointing out that the proposed structure comes at a time when Bangladesh is actively courting global investors. EuroCham echoed the concerns voiced by industry stakeholders during BERC's public hearing in February and backed calls for a more inclusive, consultative reform process. The chamber encouraged BERC to engage more deeply with both foreign and domestic stakeholders when crafting energy policies that impact long-term business planning. “Energy pricing must align with Bangladesh's broader goals of industrial resilience, energy security, and sustainable development,"" the chamber noted. Reaffirming its commitment to Bangladesh's development journey, EuroCham pledged to work closely with the government to shape policies that foster inclusive growth and a globally competitive investment climate. With energy reforms at a critical juncture, the chamber's message underscores the need for policy alignment that not only addresses sustainability but also nurtures the confidence of investors driving the country's industrial future. The cost of doing business is high that sometimes erode the competiveness of the local industries, said business leaders in Bangladesh demanding an improvement in ease of doing business to establish a conducive trade and investment ecosystem. The major challenges for the national budget for the fiscal year 2024-25 will be controlling inflation, increasing the foreign exchange reserves, exports, and the tax-GDP ratio, and bringing reforms in the banking sector. Global FDI amounted to $1.3 trillion in 2022, with nearly half being made in Asia. South Asia saw an overall 7 percent increase, but Bangladesh witnessed a decline. ""Additionally, the customs, tax and VAT systems have to be automated and if the National Logistics Development Policy is implemented, it will help cut the cost of doing business,"" said Mahbubul Alam, president of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Emphasis should also be placed so that the interest rate of bank loans does not go up. This is because if the interest rate climbs, industrialisation and investment in the country will be hampered. According to the latest United Nations Trade and Development report, global FDI amounted to $1.3 trillion in 2022, with nearly half being made in Asia. South Asia saw an overall 7 percent increase, but Bangladesh saw a decline. FDI in Bangladesh amounted to just 0.4 percent of the country's GDP in 2022 while the ratio was 1.5 percent in India and 4.4 percent in Vietnam. In 2023, FDI to Bangladesh snapped its rising trend. Central bank data showed last week that the country received $3 billion in FDI last year, a decrease of 14 percent from $3.5 billion in 2022. An analysis of the central bank data shows that Bangladesh received $1.57 billion in net FDI in 2021. Since then, net FDI has declined each year compared to the previous one. Overall, based on revised data following the BPM6 manual, the net FDI received in 2024 is the lowest since 2020. Data prior to 2000 was recorded according to the BPM5 manual, and therefore cannot be compared with the more recent figures. The central bank data analysis shows that of the net FDI received in 2024, $622 million came from reinvested earnings. In other words, 49% of the total net FDI for the year was reinvested earnings. In addition, $545 million entered the country as equity capital. Furthermore, $104 million came as intra-company loans. When asked why reinvested earnings make up a major portion of FDI, a senior official of the central bank explained, “The return on investment in our country is quite good. As a result, many investors choose to reinvest the income they earn from their existing investments. However, in many cases, investors face various obstacles, including a shortage of US dollars, when trying to repatriate their earnings. Consequently, they are often compelled to reinvest their earnings.” According to the central bank data, in 2024, the highest investment — $416 million — was made in the banking sector. Additionally, the textile and wearing sector received $407 million in investment. Sectors such as pharmaceuticals and chemicals, power, gas and petroleum, and food also attracted significant investment. Echoing Mohammad Ali, a deputy managing director of a private bank said, “When a new government comes to power, there is often a possibility of changes in various policies, including tax rates. The current government is a short-term one, so investors are waiting to see what kind of policy changes might occur once a more stable government is in place. This is one of the key reasons behind the decline in foreign investment.” In the second week of April, the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (Bida) and the Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (Beza) jointly organised the Bangladesh Investment Summit 2025. Chowdhury Ashik Mahmud Bin Harunsaid that the investment summit successfully created immense potential for attracting both foreign and local direct investment. He pointed out that the summit drew 415 foreign delegates from 50 countries.

In a condolence message on Monday, he said: “On behalf of the government and the people of Bangladesh, we, with a heavy heart, express our deepest condolences at the sad demise of His Holiness Pope Francis, a beacon of peace, humanity and unity.” With his passing away, the Chief Adviser said, they have seen the end of an epoch of dignified papacy, honed by suave leadership qualities, carried out for uplifting human dignity, interfaith harmony, and justice for the marginalised. The leadership of Pope Francis transcended religious boundaries and inspired millions to step up efforts to build a more inclusive, tolerant and compassionate world, he said. Prof Yunus said he has been honoured to meet many times with Pope Francis and to work closely with him to foster peace, human dignity and environmental stewardship. The people of Bangladesh, who were deeply honoured by His Holiness' historic visit to Bangladesh in 2017, join the global community in mourning this great loss, he continued. The Chief Adviser said: “During this time of sorrow, we stand in solidarity with the Catholic Church and people of faith around the globe, remembering the profound impact of his teachings and the kindness he extended to all.” “May the departed soul rest in eternal peace.

Dhaka Metropolitan Senior Special Judge Md Zakir Hossain Galib passed the order on Monday, allowing a plea of the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC). Confirming the matter to newsmen, ACC Deputy Director (public relations) Aktarul Islam said the accounts have Taka 26.05 lakh in them. The ACC in its plea said it is probing allegations against Jobaer of taking money from different people, promising them of giving government jobs, amassing huge illegal wealth by misusing his power, laundering money and buying house in London through the ill-gotten money. A Dhaka court has also ordered to attach 100 acres of land in sector 19 of Purbachal New City Project which had been allocated for the construction of a 100 to 142- storey Icon Tower. The land was temporarily allotted to Power Pace Holding Limited, a company, owned by Ron Haque Sikder, Managing Director of the Sikder Group. Dhaka Metropolitan Senior Special Judge Md. Zakir Hossain Ghalib issued the order in response to a petition on Monday, filed by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), said Akhtarul Islam, ACC Deputy Director. According to the petition, a seven-member investigation team has been formed to probe allegations against Zainul Haque Sikder, Chairman of the Board of Directors of National Bank Limited, and his associates. NativeClick Ads The allegations include corruption, misuse of power, embezzlement of public funds under false pretences, illegal loans in exchange of bribes and money laundering, which are linked to Sikder Group. During the investigation, it was unearthed that RAJUK’s Central Business District (CBD) temporarily allotted the land to Power Pace Holding Limited, owned by Ron Haque Sikder for constructing an Iconic Tower in the Purbachal New City Project. The plot was allotted through a manipulated auction at a fixed rate of TK 30.25 crore per acre. Upon document review and site inspection, it was found that the Sikder Group’s private security force had taken control of the land by paying an instalment of TK 270.50 crore. A three-story building was also being constructed on the site without RAJUK’s approval. Power was supplied by self-constructed power houses. Besides, in the disguise of development work, a fabricated record was created through Fast Security Islami Bank PLC, Kawran Bazar branch. Based on this, a loan of TK 110.27 crore was approved, disbursed, and then misused through illicit transfer and conversion. The attachment of the proposed construction project has become inevitable for the sake of proper investigation of the case.","direct freez bank account jobaer attach acr land zainul","dhaka court order freez four bank account former director gener dg nation secur intellig nsi major gener retd tariq moham jobaer on account wife fahmina masud graft alleg dhaka metropolitan senior special judg md zakir hossain galib pass order mondai allow plea anticorrupt commiss acc confirm matter newsman acc deputi director public relat aktarul islam say account taka lakh acc plea say probe alleg jobaer take monei differ peopl promis give governmentern job amass huge illeg wealth misus power launder monei bui hous london illgotten monei dhaka court also order attach acr land sector purbach new citi project alloc construct storei icon tower land temporarili allot power pace hold limit compani own ron haqu sikder manag director sikder group dhaka metropolitan senior special judg md zakir hossain ghalib issu order respons petit mondai file anticorrupt commiss acc say akhtarul islam acc deputi director accord petit sevenmemb investig team form probe alleg zainul haqu sikder chairman board director nation bank limit associ nativeclick ad alleg includ corrupt misus power embezzl public fund fals pretenc illeg loan exchang bribe monei launder link sikder group investig unearth rajuk’ central busi district cbd temporarili allot land power pace hold limit own ron haqu sikder construct icon tower purbach new citi project plot allot manipul auction fix rate tk crore per acr upon document review site inspect find sikder group’ privat secur forc take control land pai instal tk crore threestori build also construct site without rajuk’ approv power suppli selfconstruct power hous besid disguis develop work fabric record creat fast secur islami bank plc kawran bazar branch base loan tk crore approv disburs misus illicit transfer convers attach propos construct project becom inevit sake proper investig case"

The suit filed Monday is part of a feud that escalated last week when the elite institution rejected a list of demands that the Trump administration said was designed to curb diversity initiatives and fight anti-semitism at the school. President Donald Trump froze $2.2bn (£1.7bn) of federal funding and also threatened the university’s tax-exempt status. “The consequences of the government’s overreach will be severe and long-lasting,” Harvard’s president Alan M. Garber said in a letter to the university on Monday. The White House responded later Monday night in a statement. “The gravy train of federal assistance to institutions like Harvard, which enrich their grossly overpaid bureaucrats with tax dollars from struggling American families is coming to an end. Taxpayer funds are a privilege, and Harvard fails to meet the basic conditions required to access that privilege”, said White House spokesman Harrison Fields. Mr Garber said the funding freeze affected critical research including studies on pediatric cancer, Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. “In recent weeks, the federal Government has launched a broad attack on the critical funding partnerships that make this invaluable research possible,” the school’s lawsuit said. NativeClick Ads “This case involves the Government’s efforts to use the withholding of federal funding as leverage to gain control of academic decisionmaking at Harvard.” Aside from funding, the Trump administration days ago also threatened Harvard's ability to enroll international students. Mr Garber, who is Jewish, acknowledged Harvard's campus has had issues with anti-semitism but said he had established task forces to work with the problem. He said the university would release the report of two task forces that looked into anti-semitism and anti-Muslim bias. The prominent US university, located in Massachusetts, is not the only institution faced with withholding of federal dollars, which play an outsized role in funding new scientific breakthroughs. The administration has targeted other private Ivy League institutions including suspending $1bn at Cornell University and $510 million at Brown University. Others such as Columbia University, the epicentre of pro-Palestinian campus protests last year, have agreed to some demands after $400 million of federal funds was threatened. The demands to Harvard included agreeing to government-approved external audits of the university's curriculum as well as hiring and admission data. In response, Harvard released a blistering letter rejecting them. ""The university will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,"" Harvard's lawyers told the administration on April 14. ""Neither Harvard nor any other private university can allow itself to be taken over by the federal government. Accordingly, Harvard will not accept the government's terms as an agreement in principle."" Former US President Barack Obama, a Harvard alum, said he supported the university.","trump su harvard fund freez","harvard univers file feder lawsuit trump administr stop billion dollar propos cut bbc report suit file mondai part feud escal last week elit institut reject list demand trump administr say design curb diver initi fight antisemit school presid donald trump freeze bn bn feder fund also threaten university’ taxexempt statu consequ governmenternment’ overreach will sever longlast harvard’ presid alan be garber say letter univers mondai white hous respond late mondai night statement gravi train feder assist institut like harvard enrich grossli overpay bureaucrat tax dollar struggl american famili come end taxpay fund privileg harvard fail meet basic condit requir access privileg say white hous spokesman harrison field mr garber say fund freez affect critic research includ studi pediatr cancer alzheimer’ diseas parkinson’ diseas recent week feder govern launch broad attack critic fund partnership make invalu research possibl school’ lawsuit say nativeclick ad case involv government’ effort us withhold feder fund leverag gain control academ decisionmak harvard asid fund trump administr dai ago also threaten harvard abil enrol intern student mr garber jewish acknowledg harvard campu issu antisemit say establish task forc work problem say univers releas report two task forc look antisemit antimuslim bia promin u univers locat massachusett institut face withhold feder dollar plai outsiz role fund new scientif breakthrough administr target privat ivi leagu institut includ suspend bn cornel univers million brown univers other columbia univers epicentr propalestinian campu protest last year agre demand million feder fund threaten demand harvard includ agre governmenternmentapprov extern audit univers curriculum good hire admiss datum respons harvard releas blister letter reject univers will surrend independ relinquish constitut right harvard lawyer tell administr april neither harvard privat univers can allow take feder governmentern accordingli harvard will accept governmentern term agreement principl former u presid barack obama harvard alum say support univers"
"science-technology","https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111819","Trump issues ‘non-tariff cheating’ warning","22/04/2025","US President Donald Trump on Sunday issued an eight-point ‘non-tariff cheating’ list, warning countries of non-tariff-related offences that could spoil relations with the US. The warning came days after Trump announced a 90-day pause on his sweeping tariffs on all countries, barring China. In the eight-point list, Trump mentioned currency manipulation - an accusation he has made previously on some countries for deliberately devaluing their currencies to make their exports more competitive while making US products costlier abroad. Another warning is about Value-Added Taxes (VATs) that are applied to imports but refunded on exports in many nations. The Republican leader also warned countries of dumping below cost, export and other government subsidies, protective agricultural standards, counterfeiting, piracy, and IP theft, and transshipping to evade tariffs. He also warned of protective technical standards, citing Japan’s ‘bowling ball test’ - a claim Trump made first in 2018. According to Trump, Japan uses a so-called “bowling ball test” to cheat US auto companies out of selling cars to Japanese consumers. “They take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and drop it on the hood of the car. If the hood dents, the car doesn’t qualify. It’s horrible,” he had said. On April 9, Trump announced a 90-day pause on his sweeping tariffs on all countries, barring China - a move that had seemed nearly impossible. According to Trump, who had introduced the slew of tariffs to address the alleged trade imbalance with the US, over 75 countries had negotiated and not retaliated against him - which led to the pause. During the 90 days, a significantly reduced reciprocal tariff of just 10 per cent would be in effect, he said. A growing alarm inside the Treasury Department over the developments in the bond market was reportedly the only factor that made Trump hit a pause on his reciprocal tariff regime._NDTV NativeClick Ads","trump issu nontariff cheat warn","u presid donald trump sundai issu eightpoint nontariff cheat list warn countri nontariffrel offenc spoil relat u warn come dai trump announc dai paus sweep tariff countri bar china eightpoint list trump mention currenc manipul accus make previous countri deliber devalu currenc make export competit make u product costly abroad anoth warn valuead tax vat appli import refund export mani nation republican leader also warn countri dump cost export governmentern subsidi protect agricultur standard counterfeit piraci ip theft transship evad tariff also warn protect technic standard cite japan’ bowl ball test claim trump make first accord trump japan us socal bowl ball test cheat u auto compani sell car japanes consum take bowl ball foot air drop hood car hood dent car doesn’t qualifi it’ horribl say april trump announc dai paus sweep tariff countri bar china move seem nearli imposs accord trump introduc slay tariff address alleg trade imbal u countri negoti retali lead paus dai significantli reduc reciproc tariff just per cent effect say grow alarm insid treasuri depart develop bond market reportedli factor make trump hit paus reciproc tariff regimendtv nativeclick ad"

The certificate released on Monday for the 88-year-old pontiff said the pope had fallen into a coma before his death on Monday morning. Francis died of “cerebral stroke, coma, irreversible cardiocirculatory collapse”, the death certificate said. It added that the first Latin American pontiff in the history of the Roman Catholic Church died at 7:35am (05:35 GMT) in his apartment at the Santa Marta residence in the Vatican. Just a day earlier, the pontiff made what would be his final major appearance as he greeted thousands of Easter worshippers from an open-top popemobile in St Peter’s Square and delivered a blessing through an aide. Francis had suffered various ailments during his 12-year papacy with life-threatening complications in recent weeks during a bout of double pneumonia, for which he spent 38 days at Rome’s Gemelli University Hospital in February and March. The death certificate added that Francis also suffered from arterial hypertension, multiple bronchiectasis and type 2 diabetes, ailments that had not been previously disclosed. The Vatican also released Francis’s spiritual testament – a written statement of faith – in which he said he wished to be buried in Rome’s Basilica of St Mary Major and not at St Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican, unlike many of his predecessors. Francis’s death marks the beginning of nine days of mourning called the Novendiale. NativeClick Ads His body will be dressed in papal vestments and placed in St Peter’s Basilica for public viewing before his burial. Daily prayer services and Requiem Masses will be held in Catholic churches worldwide and at St Peter’s Basilica during this time.

""We are aware that poverty is not created by poor people. It is a consequence of an economic system where resources surge upwards, concentrating wealth ever more narrowly,"" he said. Prof Yunus made the remarks while delivering his keynote speech on 'Exploring the role of social business, financial inclusion, and microfinance in fostering sustainable development and economic opportunities for marginalised communities' at Earthna Summit, organised by Qatar Foundation, in Doha, Qatar. He said social business armed with the power of financial inclusion can break free of this trap and can move millions out of poverty. ""Today, I will share the firsthand experiences of the power of two interrelated innovative approaches of social business and microcredit that have uplifted marginalised communities in my own country,"" he said. In Bangladesh, the chief adviser said microcredit model showed that even the poorest individuals are creditworthy. By offering small, collateral-free loans, microcredit empowers individuals to build livelihoods, generate income, and lift themselves and their families out of poverty, he said. The Grameen Bank founder said microcredit has a strong track record of success, most notably through the pioneering work of Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. NativeClick Ads Founded on trust, he said the bank provided collateral-free microloans to poor villagers, especially women. It has empowered over 300 million people globally by unlocking their entrepreneurial potential, he mentioned. Prof Yunus said Grameen Bank itself lends over US$ 2.5 billion annually to 9 million women with a remarkable repayment rate of nearly 99%. He said this model has been successfully replicated in various countries, including the United States through Grameen America, while over US$ 600 million in loans was provided to over 86,000 low-income women with a repayment rate exceeding 99%.

In January 2023, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) declared the TRF a “terrorist organisation” under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for propaganda on terror activities, recruitment of terrorists, infiltration of terrorists and smuggling of weapons and narcotics from Pakistan into Jammu and Kashmir, reports indianexpress. The move had come months after TRF issued threats to journalists in Kashmir. According to a notification issued by the MHA then, TRF came into existence in 2019 as a proxy outfit of LeT. “TRF is recruiting youth through online medium for furtherance of terrorist activities and has been also involved in carrying out propaganda on terror activities, recruitment of terrorists, infiltration of terrorists and smuggling of weapons and narcotics from Pakistan into J&K. TRF is involved in psychological operations on social media platforms for inciting people of J&K to join terrorist outfits against the Indian state,” the notification said.

The verified @Israel account on social media platform X published a message that read: “Rest in Peace, Pope Francis. May his memory be a blessing,” accompanied by an image of the Pope during a 2014 visit to the Western Wall in Jerusalem. The post was removed shortly after it went live. The Jerusalem Post quoted officials at the foreign ministry as saying that the pope had made “statements against Israel” and that the social media post had been published in “error”. Francis, who died on Monday aged 88, suggested last November that the global community should study whether Israel’s military campaign in Gaza constitutes a genocide of the Palestinian people, in some of his most explicit criticism yet of Israel’s conduct in its war with Hamas that began in October 2023. In January the pope also called the humanitarian situation in Gaza ‘shameful’, prompting criticism from Rome’s chief Jewish rabbi who accused Francis of “selective indignation”.

The chief adviser said this while addressing a high-level roundtable titled ‘Social and Environment Challenges Around Forcibly Displaced Populations-The Case of the Rohingya’ at Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Doha on Wednesday. In his speech, Prof Yunus said prolonged stay of the Rohingyas poses enormous challenges to Bangladesh and making these Rohingyas frustrated. He observed that rise in criminal activities in the refugee camps in Bangladesh and attempts of illegal migration are clear signs of desperation among them. “If the problem persists further, it may affect the security and stability of the entire region and jeopardise development initiatives,” he added. Unfortunately, the chief adviser said international attention is gradually shifting from the Rohingya crisis due to various conflicts arising at different corners of the globe. He said Qatar can use its good offices to put pressure on Myanmar for starting repatriation of Rohingya people without any further delay. Given the renewed international geopolitical and geostrategic scenario, Qatar can strongly express their solidarity to resolve the issue and be proactive to engage the OIC countries to raise more funds and impose pressure on the international community to advocate for the repatriation of the Rohingyas, he said. The chief adviser said Bangladesh is currently hosting about 1.3 million forcibly displaced Myanmar nationals (Rohingyas), while 32,000 newborns are being added yearly. NativeClick Ads Despite numerous challenges and constraints, he said Bangladesh is giving shelter to such a huge number of Rohingyas only on humanitarian considerations.

Additionally, 386,805 (mostly Rakhine) people are newly displaced across 1,219 different sites, reflecting the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the region,” he said.

Pakistan took the decisions on Thursday as tit-for-tat retaliatory actions ramp up between the two powers after an attack in Kashmir that killed 26 people. The victims were mostly Indian tourists who had been visiting Pahalgam, a popular tourist destination in the Indian-held part of the territory, which both nuclear-armed nations claim as their own. In response to the attack, India closed a border crossing, suspended a water-sharing treaty and downgraded diplomatic ties with Pakistan - which it blames for the assault. The Indian government did not publicly produce any evidence connecting the attack to its neighbour, but said it had ""cross-border"" links to Pakistan. Pakistan has denied the accusations and a previously unknown militant group calling itself Kashmir Resistance has claimed responsibility. On Thursday, India's foreign ministry said all visas issued to Pakistani nationals would be revoked, effective from Sunday. It also advised Indian citizens not to travel to Pakistan and announced other measures including cutting the number of diplomatic staff and closing the only functional land border crossing between the nations. In return, Pakistan said it was closing its airspace to all Indian-owned and operated airlines and suspending all trade with India - including to and from any third country. NativeClick Ads As a result of the airspace closure, Air India announced that flights to the UK, as well as to North America, Europe and the Middle East, would be forced to take an alternative longer route.

The security forces ""effectively responded"" to the Pakistan Army, they said, adding that there were no casualties. “There were incidents of small arms firing at some places along the LoC initiated by Pakistan last night. The firing was effectively responded to,” sources said. The exchange of fire took place days after a terror attack on tourists in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam sparked a new crisis between the two neighbours. India has hit Pakistan with a series of strict measures, including expulsion of Pakistani military attaches, suspension of the over six-decade-old Indus Water Treaty and immediate shutting down of the Attari land-transit post, in view of the ""cross-border links"" to Tuesday's Pahalgam terror attack, that left 26 people, including a Nepali national, dead. India on Thursday also formally notified Pakistan that the decision to indefinitely suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, signed in 1960, comes into effect immediately. A letter from the Union Ministry of Water Resources to Syed Ali Murtuza, Secretary in the Ministry of Water Resources of Pakistan, said, ""The obligation to honour a treaty in good faith is fundamental to a treaty. However, what we have seen instead is sustained cross-border terrorism by Pakistan targeting the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir"". ""These changes include significantly altered population demographics, the need to accelerate the development of clean energy and other changes in the assumptions underlying the sharing of waters under the Treaty,"" the letter, which came shortly after Pakistan threatened to suspend all agreements between the two countries, including the Simla pact of 1972, which validates the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, read. NativeClick Ads India said in addition, consistent cross-border terrorism has given rise to ""uncertainties' that have ""directly impeded India's full utilization of its rights under the Treaty"". ""Furthermore, apart from other breaches committed by it, Pakistan has refused to respond to India's request to enter into negotiations as envisaged under the Treaty and is thus in breach of the Treaty,"" the letter read. The decision to put the Indus water agreement on hold was announced on Wednesday after a meeting of the Cabinet Committee of Security chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has vowed that India will ""identify, track and punish"" every terrorist and their ""backers"" who were behind the Pahalgam attack.

The deal is reportedly in the works in advance of a planned trip by US President Donald Trump to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates next month, Reuters reported on Thursday. Top defence contractors such as Lockheed Martin, RTX Corp, Boeing, Northrop Grumman and General Atomics are reported to be involved in the supply of advanced weapons systems. Several executives from the companies are expected to join Trump’s delegation for the visit. The sources say the contractor could see Riyadh supplied with a range of weapons including C-130 transport aircraft, missiles and radar systems. It is unlikely, however, that Saudi Arabia will gain access to Lockheed Martin’s F-35 fighter jet. Only a select number of countries can buy F-35s from the US, such as NATO allies, Japan, South Korea and Australia. Trump’s predecessor, President Joe Biden, tried unsuccessfully to sign a new defence pact with Saudi Arabia with the broader aim of normalising relations with Israel.

This comes as tensions soared between the two neighbouring countries after both took multiple actions after the terror attack. Donald Trump, while speaking to reporters on Air Force One, said that there is a history of conflict between India and Pakistan over the border region, but did not answer when asked if he would contact the two countries regarding the dispute. “They’ll get it figured out one way or the other,” he said as he travelled aboard his plane. “There’s great tension between Pakistan and India, but there always has been.” 26 civilians were killed and others were left injured after terrorists opened fire on a group of tourists in Kashmir’s Pahalgam. The Resistance Front (TRF), a proxy of the banned Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), claimed responsibility for the attack. On Thursday, State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce, when asked if Washington is playing any role in de-escalating tensions between India and Pakistan, said, “What I can tell you is, of course, as we all know, it’s a rapidly changing situation and we are monitoring it closely, as you might imagine. And we, of course, are not now taking a position on the status of Kashmir or of Jammu either, so that’s really going to be the extent of what I can say today.” When asked if President Trump had offered to mediate between India and Pakistan during his first term, Bruce said, “I’m not going to be remarking… as I mentioned.” On Wednesday, Donald Trump strongly condemned the terror attack in Pahalgam in a phone call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and expressed full support to India to bring to justice the perpetrators of the “heinous attack.” NativeClick Ads (With inputs from Reuters, PTI)","trump sai indiapakistan tension","u presid donald trump fridai speak pahalgam terror attack fallout say india pakistan will figur solut tension come tension soar two neighbour countri take multipl action terror attack donald trump speak report air forc on say histori conflict india pakistan border region answer ask contact two countri regard disput they’ll get figur on wai say travel aboard plane there’ great tension pakistan india alwai civilian kill other leave injur terrorist open fire group tourist kashmir’ pahalgam resist front trf proxi ban pakistanbas lashkaretaiba let claim respons attack thursdai state depart spokesperson tammi bruce ask washington plai role deescal tension india pakistan say can tell cours know it’ rapidli chang situat monitor close may imagin cours now take posit statu kashmir jammu either that’ realli go extent can sai todai ask presid trump offer mediat india pakistan first term bruce say i’m go remark mention wednesdai donald trump strongli condemn terror attack pahalgam phone call prime minist narendra modi express full support india bring justic perpetr heinou attack nativeclick ad input reuter pti"

Addressing a large rally in Sukkur, Bilawal declared that the Indus belongs to Pakistan and will remain so, despite New Delhi’s unilateral moves. “Let Modi hear this clearly — the Indus is ours, and it will remain ours. Either our water will flow, or their blood will,” he warned, standing on the banks of the historic river. The PPP chairman strongly condemned India’s decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty following accusations against Pakistan over the recent Pahalgam terror attack. He accused Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of levelling “false and baseless” allegations to cover internal failures and mislead the Indian public. “Whenever there is unrest in Kashmir, India blames Pakistan to distract from its own weaknesses,” Bilawal asserted. He emphasised that India’s unilateral withdrawal from the Indus Waters Treaty, a binding international agreement, would not be recognised either globally or by the people of Pakistan. “Modi’s efforts to take over the Indus will fail. We are the rightful heirs and defenders of the Sindhu (Indus), and we will protect it at all costs,” he said. Bilawal reaffirmed that Pakistan’s armed forces are fully prepared to deliver a strong response to any Indian aggression. “We will confront India bravely, and our forces will give them a fitting reply at the borders,” he said. He urged the people of Pakistan to unite in defending the country’s water rights and sovereignty. “All four provinces must stand together to deliver a strong, united response to Modi’s provocations,” he said, calling on Pakistanis to act as ambassadors of the Indus River and protect their heritage.

The funeral began at 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. EST) in St. Peter’s Square with Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, dean of the College of Cardinals, presiding over it.

One person was killed and a 14-year-old girl wounded in the city of Pavlohrad in the Dnipropetrovsk region, which was hit for the third consecutive night, regional Gov. Serhii Lysak said, AP reports. The attacks came hours after Russia claimed to have regained control over the remaining parts of the Kursk region, which Ukrainian forces seized in a surprise incursion last August. Ukrainian officials said the fighting in Kursk was still ongoing. Trump said Saturday that he doubts Putin wants to end the more than three-year war in Ukraine, expressing new skepticism that a peace deal can be reached soon. Only a day earlier, Trump had said Ukraine and Russia were “very close to a deal.” “There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,” Trump wrote in a social media post as he flew back to the United States after attending Pope Francis’ funeral at the Vatican, where he met briefly with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump also hinted at further sanctions against Russia. The Trump-Zelenskyy conversation on the sidelines of the pope’s funeral was the first face-to-face encounter between the two leaders since they argued during a heated Oval Office meeting at the White House in late February. Russia fired 149 exploding drones and decoys in the latest wave of attacks, the Ukrainian air force said, adding that 57 were intercepted and another 67 jammed. One person also was wounded in drone attacks on the Odesa region and another in the city of Zhitomir, according to local officials.

He made such comment in an interview with Al Jazeera on Sunday (April 27). Next national polls will be held within June 2026, Prof Yunus said in the interview with Al Jazeera’s ‘Talk to Al Jazeera’ event. He also said the timeline will depend on how many reforms all agree or disagree on. If the consensus is on a larger number of reforms, then it will take longer. “If we can focus on a smaller version of the [reform] implementation, then we will have an early election in December,” he said in the interview that was aired yesterday. “However, if the process takes longer, we go up to June, but we will not go beyond June,” he added. Yunus promised that the next election will be best ever election in the country’s history. Asked if the Awami League will be allowed to take part in the polls, Yunus said, “We don't know yet, they [AL] have not declared anything.” NativeClick Ads He said once the declaration comes, then the matter of the response from the Election Commission and other factors will arise. Then there are other parties who may say that under this law they cannot participate and so on, he added. Asked whether the “honeymoon period” for the interim government was over, Yunus said people think the interim government is still a good solution for them. “They’re not saying let the interim government go, have the election today… We have not faced any such problem of people saying that ‘hand it [power] over as soon as possible’,” he added. Asked about ousted PM’s claim that she is still the “rightful prime minister” and how the government viewed her presence in India, he said he had a meeting with Indian PM Narendra Modi during the BIMSTEC Summit in Bangkok. “I made it very clear that, okay if you [Modi] want to keep her that is probably not something that I can settle with you, but definitely while she’s there, she should not be talking because it creates a lot of problems for us. “She’s giving speeches to incite people inside of Bangladesh, and we have to suffer from that,” Yunus added. Asked about Modi's response, Yunus said, “If I recollect, he said this [India] is a country where social media is open to anybody. I cannot control that.” Asked if he thought India was offering Sheikh Hasina political cover, should she face justice back home, Yunus said, “We have already sent a letter to Indian government to send her to Bangladesh. They have not responded yet, but when the legal procedures begin and the court will give the notice …” he added. The anchor then said, “So let me get this straight you’re saying that Prime Minister Modi has told you we can’t do anything about her freedom of speech in a country India that has been accused of stifling freedom of speech and in no way have you been given any kind of guarantees that she will be sent back to face justice?” Yunus said, “no.” On Bangladesh and India relations, Yunus said, “This is one of the cases that we have to resolve ourselves … we understand what their legal situation is, what our legal situation is. But we are waiting for the legal notice from the court.” Asked if Yunus decided to visit China first deliberately before India and whether he was sending a message, Yunus said he was visiting countries where he would like to go. “I tried to go to India, but they didn’t respond to it. So, I went to China, and now I’ll go to Malaysia,” he said. He said he is visiting countries to revive SAARC. Asked if India has given him a cold shoulder, and is he now deepening ties with Pakistan as an alternative, Yunus said, “I will not say cold shoulder. It’s maybe a temporary thing… something we have to resolve together. I’ll not take this as a final thing, it’s not something long-lasting.” Talking about Bangladesh’s relationship with the Trump administration, Yunus said his government has a very good, strong, and warm relationship with the Trump administration. Asked if he saw the US as a reliable partner or was he being forced to choose between Beijing and Washington DC, Yunus said, “No this is not a question of choice, they’re all our friends. The USA is a good friend, China is a good friend, India is a good friend.” Yunus said that foreign governments are helping Bangladesh so that Bangladesh could get back its money laundered abroad.","peopl think interim govern still good solut","chief advis prof muhammad yunu say peopl think interim governmentern still good solut make comment interview al jazeera sundai april next nation poll will hold within june prof yunu say interview al jazeera’ talk al jazeera event also say timelin will depend mani reform agre disagre consensu large numb reform will take long can focu small version reform implement will earli elect decemb say interview air yesterdai howev process take long go june will go beyond june ad yunu promis next elect will good ever elect country’ histori ask awami leagu will allow take part poll yunu say know yet al declar anyth nativeclick ad say declar come matter respons elect commiss factor will aris parti mai sai law particip ad ask whether honeymoon period interim governmentern yunu say peopl think interim governmentern still good solut they’r sai let interim governmentern go elect todai face problem peopl sai hand power soon possibl ad ask oust pm’ claim still right prime minist governmentern view presenc india say meet indian pm narendra modi bimstec summit bangkok make clear okai modi want keep probabl someth can settl definit she’ talk creat lot problem u she’ give speech incit peopl insid bangladesh suffer yunu ad ask modi respons yunu say recollect say india countri social medium open anybodi control ask think india offer sheikh hasina polit cover face justic back home yunu say alreadi send letter indian governmentern send bangladesh respond yet legal procedur begin court will give notic ad anchor say let get straight you’r sai prime minist modi tell can’t anyth freedom speech countri india accus stifl freedom speech wai give kind guarante will send back face justic yunu say bangladesh india relat yunu say on case resolv understand legal situat legal situat wait legal notic court ask yunu decid visit china first deliber india whether send messag yunu say visit countri like go tri go india didn’t respond go china now i’ll go malaysia say say visit countri reviv saarc ask india give cold shoulder now deepen ti pakistan altern yunu say will sai cold shoulder it’ mayb temporari thing someth resolv togeth i’ll take final thing it’ someth longlast talk bangladesh’ relationship trump administr yunu say governmentern good strong warm relationship trump administr ask see u reliabl partner forc choos beij washington dc yunu say question choic they’r friend usa good friend china good friend india good friend yunu say foreign governmentern help bangladesh bangladesh get back monei launder abroad"

This was the first time that the Pakistan Army violated the ceasefire in the Poonch sector. The exchange of fire between Indian and Pakistani troops started after 26 people were killed in a terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam last Tuesday. Relations between India and Pakistan have soured further after the role of a terror group linked to Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba emerged in the Pahalgam terror attack -- the worst in Jammu and Kashmir since the Pulwama incident. India has hit Pakistan with a series of strict measures, including expulsion of Pakistani military attaches, suspension of the over six-decade-old Indus Waters Treaty and immediate shutting down of the Attari land-transit post. The decisions were taken on Wednesday after a meeting of the Cabinet Committee of Security chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has vowed that India will “identify, track and punish” every terrorist and their “backers” who were behind the deadly attack.

The KCNA quoted Kim as saying that soldiers were deployed to “annihilate and wipe out the Ukrainian neo-Nazi occupiers and liberate the Kursk area in cooperation with the Russian armed forces”. “They who fought for justice are all heroes and representatives of the honour of the motherland,” KCNA quoted Kim as saying. North Korea “regards it as an honour to have an alliance with such a powerful state as the Russian Federation”, KCNA said. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Kim signed a comprehensive strategic partnership treaty in June last year, committing the two countries to come to each other’s assistance, militarily, in the event of war. According to South Korea’s official Yonhap News Agency, Kim also said that a monument would be built soon in the capital, Pyongyang, to honour those who had fought against Ukraine.

"science-technology","https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/111965","India taking preparations to attack Pakistan","28/04/2025","Since the horrific terrorist attack in Kashmir last week, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, has spoken on the phone with more than a dozen world leaders. Diplomats from 100 missions in India’s capital have filed into the foreign ministry for briefings, officials said. But the effort is largely not about rallying help to de-escalate India’s dangerous face-off with Pakistan, which it accuses of having “linkages” to the attack. Instead, according to four diplomatic officials aware of the discussions, New Delhi appears to be building a case for military action against its neighbor and archenemy. Without naming Pakistan, Mr. Modi in a speech on Thursday promised severe punishment and the razing of terror safe havens. In an indication of how volatile the situation remains, the security forces of the two sides have exchanged intermittent small-arms fire across the border, Indian officials said on Sunday. One official said the exchange of fire had happened two of the past three nights, while a second official said it was three consecutive nights. In Kashmir, Indian forces have also begun a sweeping clampdown, arresting hundreds, as they continue their hunt for the perpetrators. NativeClick Ads Earlier, India declared its intention to disrupt the flow of water to Pakistan, whose irrigation system depends largely on upstream rivers. It also ordered the immediate departure of some staff members at Pakistan’s diplomatic mission as well as of Pakistani citizens visiting India. Pakistan, for its part, has said it will suspend participation in bilateral treaties, including one that affects the “line of control” demarcating the frontier between the two countries in the disputed areas where a cease-fire had held for several years. Anti-Muslim sentiment in India is also intensifying, with Kashmiri students studying in other Indian cities in particular facing widespread harassment and many of them feeling compelled to return home. Five days after the terrorist assault, in which gunmen killed 26 civilians, India has not officially identified any group as having carried out the massacre, and it has publicly presented little evidence to support its claim that Pakistan was behind it. The Pakistani government has denied involvement. In the briefings to diplomats at the foreign ministry, Indian officials have described Pakistan’s past patterns of support for terrorist groups targeting India, diplomatic officials said. The Indian officials have said their investigation is continuing, and made brief references to technical intelligence tying the perpetrators of last week’s attack to Pakistan, including facial recognition data. The lack of strong evidence offered so far, analysts and diplomats said, pointed to one of two possibilities: that India needs more time to gather information about the terrorist attack before striking Pakistan, or that — in a time of particular chaos on the world stage — it feels little need to justify to anyone the actions it plans to take. A military confrontation between India and Pakistan, both armed with nuclear weapons, runs the risk of rapid escalation that could be difficult to contain. But India is largely unrestrained by any global pressure to limit its response, and it has become quicker to flex its muscles in recent years as its diplomatic and economic power has grown. The governments of Iran and Saudi Arabia have spoken to the two sides, and Iran’s foreign minister has publicly offered to mediate. The United Nations and the European Union have called for restraint and dialogue. But major powers, including the United States, are distracted by other crises, and analysts say India is interpreting the expressions of support by many countries for its pursuit of justice as a green light for any measures it takes. Trump administration officials have voiced strong backing of India’s fight against terrorism. President Trump has said he is friendly with both India and Pakistan, while noting that they have long been at odds. But it is unclear how involved Washington will get in the current clash. Three months into his term, Mr. Trump has still not named an ambassador to India, a sign of where South Asia ranks in his list of priorities.

It was disclosed in the third quarter (Q3) unaudited financial statements of the company for the period ended 31 March, 2025. The report was published after reviewed and approved by the Company's Board of Directors in its 44th meeting held on Sunday (April 27, 2025). The report says, following the post pandemic impact and Russian's invasion of Ukraine, global economy continues to be weakened through significant disruptions in trade, food and fuel price shocks, all of which are contributing to high inflation and subsequent tightening in global financing conditions. Besides, the price hike of material, vulnerable global market condition and devaluation of Bangladesh currency against foreign currencies have increased material cost drastically and also higher inflation rate has been impacted on company's operating cost. In addition, VAT on the supply of refrigerator has been increased to 7.5 percent from 5 percent and also 7.5 percent VAT has been imposed on the supply of air conditioner under the Finance Act 2024. Due to increased cost pressures, the company’s operating profit margin during the July-March period of 2024-2025 declined to 22.09% from 24.73% in the previous year’s same period. In addition, the finance cost as a percentage of sales rose to 7.29% from 6.14%, driven by higher borrowing costs and devaluation of Bangladesh currency against dollar. As a result of these combined economic and political challenges, the net profit after tax for the period ended 31 March, 2025 stood at TK.696.44 crore and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of Tk 22.99 whereas in comparative period ended 31 March, 2024 the net profit after tax was Tk 762.34 crore and EPS was Tk 25.17. As on March 31 of 2025, the Company's Net Asset Value Per Share (NAVPS) stood at Tk 277.04 without revaluation and Tk 378.42 with revaluation. NativeClick Ads The Company’s Net Operating Cash Flows Per Share (NOCFPS) for the period ended 31 March, 2025 stood at Tk 1.83 negative, a decline from Tk 22.88 in the previous period. This decrease is primarily due to a strategic shift in working capital management, whereby payments to suppliers were made using collections from customers rather than bank borrowings. Furthermore, payments to suppliers for goods and services, as well as disbursements to the Government Exchequer for income tax and VAT, increased in line with higher procurement volumes aimed at supporting anticipated sales growth during the current and upcoming peak seasons. These strategic adjustments in cash flow management reflect our long-term commitment to sustainable growth and operational resilience, reinforcing our position in the market. However, the management anticipated that the company’s profits would be healthier in the last quarter (April-June) of the current Financial Year following the peak season of sales. Along with the third quarter financial statements, the Board of the Company also approved the Lithium-Ion Battery Cell Project. The primary objectives of this project are to develop a fully operational sophisticated manufacturing facility capable of producing high quality lithium-ion cells and reducing dependency on imports and providing a competitive, locally manufactured products. Commercial production will be commenced by the mid-2026. As a pioneer in producing lithium-ion battery cell, Walton will not only foster technological innovation and set a benchmark for quality and sustainability but also reduce reliance on imports, create new employment opportunities, technological growth and exports.","walton record tk cr profit july’march","walton hitech industri plc country’ lead electr electron manufactur compani list capit market record tk crore net profit first nine month july’march financi year fy disclos 3 quarter q unaudit financi statement compani period end march report publish review approv compani board director th meet hold sundai april report sai follow post pandem impact russian invas ukrain global economi continu weaken signific disrupt trade food fuel price shock contribut high inflat subsequ tighten global financ condit besid price hike materi vulner global market condit devalu bangladesh currenc foreign currenc increas materi cost drastic also high inflat rate impact compani oper cost addit vat suppli refriger increas percent percent also percent vat impos suppli air condition financ act due increas cost pressur company’ oper profit margin julymarch period declin previou year’ period addit financ cost percentag sale rise drive high borrow cost devalu bangladesh currenc dollar result combin econom polit challeng net profit tax period end march stand tk crore earn per share ep tk wherea compar period end march net profit tax tk crore ep tk march compani net asset valu per share navp stand tk without revalu tk revalu nativeclick ad company’ net oper cash flow per share nocfp period end march stand tk neg declin tk previou period decreas primarili due strateg shift work capit manag wherebi payment supplier make us collect custom rather bank borrow furthermor payment supplier good servic good disburs govern exchequ incom tax vat increas line high procur volum aim support anticip sale growth current upcom peak season strateg adjust cash flow manag reflect longterm commit sustain growth oper resili reinforc posit market howev manag anticip company’ profit healthy last quarter apriljun current financi year follow peak season sale along 3 quarter financi statement board compani also approv lithiumion batteri cell project primari object project develop fulli oper sophist manufactur facil capabl produc high qualiti lithiumion cell reduc depend import provid competit local manufactur product commerci product will commenc mid pioneer produc lithiumion batteri cell walton will foster technolog innov set benchmark qualiti sustain also reduc relianc import creat new employ opportun technolog growth export"

Luis Montenegro, the prime minister of Portugal, says there is “no indication” that a cyberattack caused the power outage. Spain's government was scrambling to identify the origin of the huge outage, with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez going to the headquarters of the state electricity network operator to be briefed. The operator, Red Electrica, said it would likely take six to 10 hours to restore power in the country and urged people not to speculate as to the cause of the outage. The outage has led to significant disruptions, affecting traffic lights, halting transport networks and leaving hospitals without electricity.

Calling itself the “victim of cross border terrorism”, India flagged the Pakistan Defence Minister’s “open confession” to training and funding terrorists. Ambassador Yojna Patel, India’s Deputy Permanent Representative at the UN, said his confession was not surprising and it exposed Pakistan as a “rogue state” that has been fuelling global terrorism. “The world can no longer turn a blind eye,” added Ambassador Patel. On the sidelines, on the night of April 28-29, Pakistani troops violated the ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir for the fifth consecutive night. However, the Indian Army responded in a “measured and effective” manner, officials said. The firing took place in areas opposite Kupwara and Baramulla districts, as well as the Akhnoor sector. On Monday, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh briefed Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the security preparedness in Jammu and Kashmir following the Pahalgam terror attack. The meeting came a day after Mr Singh met the Chief of General Staff (CDS) General Anil Chauhan to discuss the key decisions taken up by the military to counter Pakistan following the horrific terrorist attack in Pahalgam. 25 tourists and a Kashmiri local were shot dead in cold blood at Baisaran meadow in Pahalgam on April 22.

Mirroring a theme of the campaign, Carney used his victory speech to claim Trump wanted to “break us, so that America can own us”. “That will never, ever happen,” he said to shouts from the crowd. Carney gave a stark assessment of a world order once defined by an integrated global trading system with the US at the centre, saying such a system was over, and he pledged to reshape Canada’s relationships with other nations. “We are over the shock over American betrayal. But we will never forget the lessons,” he said. Carney praised other party leaders for campaigns that he said had strengthened the country’s democracy. “Let’s put an end to the division and anger of the past. We are all Canadian and my government will work for and with everyone.” Earlier in the evening as results from Canada’s Atlantic provinces and vote-rich Quebec and Ontario came in, supporters at the Liberals’ election night party erupted in cheers as it became clear the party would win. It was not immediately clear if the Liberals would have enough seats for a majority government. If it falls short it would need the support of political rivals to govern.

The Press Secretary said this while responding to a question of a journalist over reports about the UN ‘humanitarian corridor’ to Rakhine State of Myanmar through Cox's Bazar. “We want to make it categorically clear that the government has not discussed about the so-called humanitarian corridor with the UN or any other entity,” he said.

We are no longer dependent on the IMF and the World Bank (WB),” he said while talking to the reporters after two separate meetings on the Advisers Council Committee on Economic Affairs and the Advisers Council Committee on Government Purchase at the Cabinet Division Conference Room at Bangladesh Secretariat on Tuesday. He said IMF had acknowledged the macroeconomic stability of Bangladesh, including the stable state of foreign currency reserves and exchange rate compared to the situation in the last December. While divulging the outcomes of his recent tour to the USA attending the Annual Meetings of the World Bank and the IMF, he said that now in Bangladesh, the macroeconomic stability is far better as the IMF had also recognized it compared to the country’s condition in the last December. “Without receiving any further fund from the IMF, we’ve managed to make stable the foreign currency reserves and the exchange rate. We’ve ensured macroeconomic stability without their support and this is a proof,” he added.

In a social media post early on Wednesday, Attaullah Tarar accused India of using last week’s attack in Pahalgam, which killed 26 tourists, “as a false pretext” to potentially strike Pakistan. The minister did not provide any concrete information to back up his claim, and the Indian government did not immediately comment publicly on the allegations. “Any act of aggression will be met with a decisive response. India will be fully responsible for any serious consequences in the region,” Tarar said in the post on X. Pakistani Minister of Defence Khawaja Muhammad Asif also told the Reuters news agency on Monday that a military incursion by India was “imminent”. Islamabad is on high alert but will only use its nuclear weapons if “there is a direct threat to our existence”, Asif said. India’s Ministry of External Affairs did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Reuters news agency on the latest remarks from Tarar. Tensions between the two countries have been rising after India said there were Pakistani elements linked to the attack on April 22 in the mountain resort of Pahalgam. NativeClick Ads It was the deadliest attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir in more than two decades, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised to pursue the attackers. A statement issued in the name of The Resistance Front (TRF), which is believed to be an offshoot of the Pakistani-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, claimed responsibility for the attack. But Islamabad has denied any role in what happened and called for a neutral investigation. After the attack, the neighbours unleashed a raft of diplomatic measures against each other, including visa revocations and the closure of Pakistani airspace to Indian airlines. India also suspended its participation in the Indus Waters Treaty, which regulates water-sharing from the Indus River and its tributaries between the two countries. The move spurred protests in Pakistan, and the Pakistani government has said it is preparing legal action over New Delhi’s decision. Fire also has been exchanged along the Line of Control (LoC), the 740km (460-mile) de-facto border separating Indian- and Pakistani-controlled areas of Kashmir, prompting international calls to de-escalate tensions. On Tuesday, the United States urged the two countries to work towards a “responsible solution”. “We are reaching out to both parties, and telling … them to not escalate the situation,” a Department of State spokesperson told reporters, quoting a statement by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The spokesperson added that Rubio would speak to the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan on Tuesday or Wednesday and encouraged other foreign ministers to do the same. The United Nations also said Secretary-General Antonio Guterres spoke with Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Indian Minister of External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and “underscored the need to avoid a confrontation that could result in tragic consequences”.

The Senate session also witnessed a call by PPP lawmaker Syed Masroor Ahsan, who endorsed the idea floated by the PTI seeking the involvement of PTI chief Imran Khan in the multi-party conference to send a “message of unity” in the country. The idea initially floated by PTI’s Ali Zafar was recalled by PTI’s Aon Abbas in his speech on Tuesday, in which he said PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif, PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari, and PTI founder Imran Khan should participate in the moot to send a strong message. PPP’s Masroor Ahsan, while endorsing the idea, observed that the government should show flexibility and listen to the opposition. “Both sides need to set aside egos,” he remarked. Earlier, at least three senators, Allama Nasir Abbas, Gurdeep Singh and Dost Muhammad, called for the release of Imran Khan from the Adiala jail. However, PML-N Senator Nasir Butt said Imran Khan would have to face the law and prove his innocence to secure his freedom. Senator Saifullah Abro of the PTI chided former prime minister Nawaz Sharif for his purported silence over the Pahalgam attack and demanded that the political leadership make strong statements over the issue. Stern response Meanwhile, FM Ishaq Dar said Pakistan would pay back India in the same coin, but it would not initiate an attack. NativeClick Ads Sharing details of Pakistan’s diplomatic overtures following the escalation in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack, he said foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, China, the United Kingdom, Turkiye, Azerbaijan, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Hungary have been taken on board about Pakistan’s concerns. He said he also spoke directly to the prime minister of Qatar. Mr Dar praised China and Turkiye for expressing clear support for Pakistan in the wake of the crisis. “I walked them through what happened — India’s psyche, its history and our concerns about what intentions it may have in light of that history,” he told the House. Mr Dar said intelligence reports suggest that India was contemplating some form of escalation. Referring to the 2019 Pulwama attack that killed 40 Indian paramilitary personnel and was blamed on a Pakistan-based militant group, the deputy prime minister noted that New Delhi had used the incident as a pretext to revoke Article 370 of its constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir. The region was subsequently absorbed into India’s union territory framework, a move Pakistan has repeatedly condemned. Ishaq Dar also said that India had been attempting to alter the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, which determined the water-sharing mechanism between both countries, for the past two years, citing changing circumstances. “I have my doubts, much like other people, that this drama was staged to suspend this treaty,” he said while referring to the Pahalgam attack.

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Washington is urging both sides to de-escalate. “We are reaching out to both parties and telling, of course, them to not escalate the situation,” Tammy Bruce told the reporters. “Secretary Rubio believes diplomacy must take the lead,” Bruce said, noting that the Secretary has also encouraged other national leaders and foreign ministers “to reach out to the countries on this issue.” Tensions have surged between the two nuclear-armed neighbours following an attack in Pahalgam, located in Indian-Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir. The attack, which occurred on April 22, claimed the lives of 26 people, mostly tourists, making it one of the deadliest incidents in the region since the year 2000. On April 23, India unilaterally suspended the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), a critical water-sharing agreement brokered by the World Bank, which has held steady through numerous conflicts between the two countries. The next day, Pakistan retaliated by threatening to put the 1972 Simla Agreement in abeyance and closing its airspace to Indian flights. NativeClick Ads India has suggested that cross-border links may have been involved in the attack, although it has not provided concrete evidence. In contrast, Pakistan has strongly denied any involvement. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called for an independent investigation into the incident to determine the truth. Meanwhile, Information Minister Atta Tarar warned late Tuesday that Islamabad has credible intelligence indicating India may launch a military strike within the next 24 to 36 hours, using the recent Pahalgam attack as a pretext. The minister criticised India’s approach, accusing it of assuming a “self-assigned role of judge, jury and executioner” in the region, which was labelled as reckless and destabilising. “Pakistan has itself suffered immensely from terrorism and understands the pain and consequences of such violence,” the statement added, reaffirming Islamabad’s call for restraint and regional peace.

But the cavernous sports and expo centre in the city of Warren, near Detroit, was only half full for the rally, and a steady stream of people left before the end of his disjointed and meandering 89-minute address. “We’re here tonight in the heartland of our nation to celebrate the most successful first 100 days of any administration in the history of our country!” Trump declared. “In 100 days, we have delivered the most profound change in Washington in nearly 100 years.” The 45th and 47th president falsely accused the previous administration of engineering massive border invasion and allowing gangs, cartels and terrorists to infiltrate communities. “Democrats have vowed mass invasion and mass migration,” he said. “We are delivering mass deportation.” Trump defended his use of the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 wartime authority that allows the president to detain or deport the citizens of an enemy nation, to expel foreign terrorists from the US as quickly as possible. Then he took aim at the courts that have blocked many of his moves during the first 100 days._Agencies.","trump warn noth will stop","donald trump celebr th dai offic campaignstyl ralli michigan attack communist radic leave judg try seiz power warn noth will stop presid also serv chill spectacl video venezuelan immigr send u notori prison el salvador accompani hollywoodstyl music roar approv crowd report dailymail trump choic michigan recognit battleground state help propel victori vicepresid kamala harri last november’ elect statu potenti beneficiari tariff polici claim will reviv u manufactur cavern sport expo centr citi warren near detroit half full ralli steadi stream peopl leave end disjoint meander minut address we’r tonight heartland nation celebr success first dai administr histori countri trump declar dai deliv profound chang washington nearli year th th presid fals accus previou administr engin massiv border invas allow gang cartel terrorist infiltr commun democrat vow mass invas mass migrat say deliv mass deport trump defend us alien enemi act wartim author allow presid detain deport citizen enemi nation expel foreign terrorist u quickli possibl take aim court block mani move first daysag"

The accord establishes a joint investment fund for Ukraine's reconstruction as Trump tries to secure a peace settlement in Russia's three-year-old war in Ukraine. The agreement is central to Kyiv's efforts to mend ties with Trump and the White House, which frayed after he took office in January.

Denzel Dumfries doubled the lead in the 21st minute with an acrobatic volley from a corner, putting the visitors in firm control, reports indiatoday. But Barcelona's teenage sensation Lamine Yamal sparked the comeback just three minutes later with a brilliant solo effort from the right, becoming the youngest player ever to score in a Champions League semi-final at 17 years and 291 days, breaking Kylian Mbappe's previous record. Yamal nearly equalised moments later when he struck the post, but Ferran Torres made it 2-2 before half-time with a composed finish after a Raphinha knock-down. Inter regained the lead in the 64th minute through Dumfries, who headed in his second of the night from another corner.

It takes a lot of time to harvest one bigha of paddy using the traditional method. Many workers are also needed to carry and thresh the crops after harvest.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with top officials from both countries on Wednesday, asking them to “maintain peace and security in South Asia.” He told Pakistan’s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, of the need to condemn the attack and re-establish direct communications, according to a statement from the State Department.

In a televised address early on Wednesday, Pakistani Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said his country had “credible intelligence” that India would carry out military action in the next 24 to 36 hours.

The press wing's statement was posted on its verified Facebook page - CA Press Wing Facts. The press wing presented the initiatives that interim government has taken to uncover the truth behind the barbaric carnage. Following are the initiatives: Investigation Commission On December 22, 2024, the government formed a seven-member National Independent Investigation Commission to reexamine the Pilkhana massacre. Chaired by retired Maj. Gen. ALM Fazlur Rahman, the commission has collected testimony from dozens of witnesses (about 37 so far, including officers, BDR personnel and victims' families). It has vowed to ""uncover the true nature of the incident,"" identify all culprits, and even probe any domestic or foreign conspiracies. On April 18, 2025 the commission issued a public notice asking anyone with reliable information or testimony about the 2009 carnage to submit it via its website or email, promising confidentiality. Pledge to Uncover Truth NativeClick Ads Home Affairs Adviser Jahangir Alam Chowdhury reaffirmed the government's commitment to a full reinvestigation of the Pilkhana events. In late February 2025, Commission Chairman Fazlur Rahman told reporters that the inquiry commission had already recorded evidence from dozens of witnesses and that it would call even top figures (e.g. then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and former Army Chief Moeen U Ahmed) as needed. He stressed that the investigation would ""uncover the true nature"" of the incident, include the real perpetrators in the cases, and examine all possible foreign or domestic plots. Public Appeal for Information On April 18, 2025 the Commission publicly invited any citizens or organisations with relevant information to come forward via its website or email. It highlighted the complexity of investigating a 16-year-old crime and assured confidentiality for informants. This suggests an official effort to be transparent and thorough, contrasting with claims that the government is covering things up. Court Cases and Releases In January 2025, hundreds of former BDR personnel were granted bail in mutiny-related cases. Contrary to Amir's allegation that they were set free with no legal procedures, the prisoners were released on bail. Families of the slain officers’ immediately protested that those who massacred army officers should not be freed wholesale. Meanwhile, survivors' families have filed new complaints (e.g. with the International Crimes Tribunal) and threatened fresh protests if justice is not secured. Victims' Memorialisation The interim government has simultaneously taken steps to honour the victims. In March 2025, the Cabinet Division officially declared Feb 25 as ""National Martyred Army Day,"" and accorded ""martyr"" status to the 57 army officers slain at Pilkhana. The press wing said Amir's affiliation with the Awami League is well known. In November 2023, she and her father, Barrister M Amir-ul Islam, collected nomination papers from the ruling Awami League for parliamentary constituencies Kushtia-3 and Kushtia-4, indicating active political engagement with the party. “Her family background is closely tied to the Awami League's legacy: her father was instrumental in drafting Bangladesh's declaration of independence and constitution, and the family has historically supported the Awami League. Although she has taken legal cases independently, she is widely seen as aligned with the party's political and ideological positions.” Given this affiliation, her recent remarks at the Geneva Press Club criticising the Interim Government and insinuating that it represents terrorists and mutineers involved in the 2009 BDR mutiny can be understood as politically motivated, the statement said. Notably, it said, Amir and other speakers at the Geneva conference did not cite any new evidence rather, they replayed claims (e.g. death tolls, indemnity laws, prisoner releases) that have circulated among opposition groups for years. “The Geneva press event is part of a diaspora-driven campaign to keep the spotlight on alleged abuses by Bangladesh's authorities and appears timed to capitalise on this attention and to project a narrative of government impunity to Western audiences. The timing coincided with the government's own steps (March 2025) to honour the mutiny's victims and call for justice,” the statement read. It claimed that Tania Amir and allies seized this moment to pitch a negative storyline that might resonate with international fears of militant Islam. The reality is that the interim government will continue to move on several fronts to ensure justice is finally done in this murky case that horrified Bangladeshis when it occurred and has divided public opinion ever since, according to the statement.","ca press wing debunk tania amir statement bdr mutini","chief advis press wing say statement tania amir bangladesh rifl mutini mislead on claim remark reflect polit agendum support depos awami leagu regim statement tania amir bangladesh rifl mutini circul social medium reflect polit agendum support depos awami leagu regim rather realiti action interim govern move energi unseen year sinc tragedi occur ensur justic do press wing say statement thursdai press wing statement post verifi facebook page ca press wing fact press wing present initi interim governmentern take uncov truth behind barbar carnag follow initi investig commiss decemb governmentern form sevenmemb nation independ investig commiss reexamin pilkhana massacr chair retir maj gen alm fazlur rahman commiss collect testimoni dozen wit far includ offic bdr personnel victim famili vow uncov true natur incid identifi culprit even probe domest foreign conspiraci april commiss issu public notic ask anyon reliabl inform testimoni carnag submit via websit email promis confidenti pledg uncov truth nativeclick ad home affair advis jahangir alam chowdhuri reaffirm governmentern commit full reinvestig pilkhana event late februari commiss chairman fazlur rahman tell report inquiri commiss alreadi record evid dozen wit call even top figur eg thenprim minist sheikh hasina former armi chief moeen u ahm need stress investig uncov true natur incid includ real perpetr case examin possibl foreign domest plot public appeal inform april commiss publicli invit citizen organis relev inform come forward via websit email highlight complex investig yearold crime assur confidenti inform suggest offici effort transpar thorough contrast claim governmentern cover thing court case releas januari hundr former bdr personnel grant bail mutinyrel case contrari amir alleg set free legal procedur prison releas bail famili slay offic immedi protest massacr armi offic free wholesal meanwhil survivor famili file new complaint eg intern crime tribun threaten fresh protest justic secur victim memorialis interim governmentern simultan take step honour victim march cabinet divis offici declar feb nation martyr armi dai accord martyr statu armi offic slay pilkhana press wing say amir affili awami leagu good know novemb father barrist be amirul islam collect nomin paper rule awami leagu parliamentari constitu kushtia kushtia indic activ polit engag parti famili background close ti awami leagu legaci father instrument draft bangladesh declar independ constitut famili histor support awami leagu although take legal case independ wide see align parti polit ideolog posit give affili recent remark geneva press club criticis interim govern insinu repres terrorist mutin involv bdr mutini can understand polit motiv statement say notabl say amir speaker geneva confer cite new evid rather replai claim eg death toll indemn law prison releas circul among opposit group year geneva press event part diasporadriven campaign keep spotlight alleg abus bangladesh author appear time capitalis attent project narr governmentern impun western audienc time coincid governmentern step march honour mutini victim call justic statement read claim tania amir alli seiz moment pitch neg storylin may reson intern fear milit islam realiti interim governmentern will continu move sever front ensur justic final do murki case horrifi bangladeshi occur divid public opinion ever sinc accord statement"

He said this while speaking at a function on Thursday at Bangladesh-China Friendship Exhibition Center marking the historic May Day and the National Occupational Health and Safety Day, 2025. Reiterating the interim government’s firm determination to build a new Bangladesh, Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus urged the workers and owners to work together to build the new Bangladesh. “The new Bangladesh could not be built if the condition of workers remains the same - that was in old Bangladesh,” he said. Prof Yunus said the aspiration of building the new Bangladesh is “our responsibility and at the same time, a big opportunity”, noting that such aspiration was not created in the country in the past. Highlighting the proposals of the Labour Reform Commission, he said it will be quite impossible to build the new Bangladesh without implementing these proposals. The Chief Adviser stressed implementing the recommendations of the Labour Reform Commission, which need to be accomplished immediately. “Later, we will start work to implement the hard proposals,” he said, adding “We have started the journey and it will continue.” Labour and Employment Adviser Brigadier General (retd) Dr M Sakhawat Hussain, Labour Reform Commission chairman Syed Sultan Uddin Ahmed and Country Director of the International Labour Organization (ILO) Bangladesh Tuomo Poutiainen were, among others, spoke at the function with Labour and Employment Secretary AHM Shafiquzzaman in the chair. NativeClick Ads Mentioning that building the new Bangladesh is the responsibility of all, Prof Yunus said the report of the Labour Reform Commission was prepared involving all stakeholders. The nation has no way to implement the recommendations of the commission in building the new Bangladesh, he said the base of new Bangladesh will be established if the proposals of the commissions could be implemented. Recalling the history of the historic May Day, Prof Yunus said in the context of the July uprising, the May Day has come before the nation with a new message. He also remembered with respect those who sacrificed their lives in establishing the rights of labourers, all working people and the workers who martyred in the July uprising. He said Bangladesh is implementing a road map with ILO, a national plan with European Union and an 11-point labour action plan with the US government. Prof Yunus said to ensure the welfare of workers, the interim government has taken various initiatives, including steps to amend the Labour Act 2006. The Chief Adviser also highlighted various government’s initiatives taken to ensure welfare of labourers and protect their rights. He said the labour unrest was significantly reduced in consultation with workers and owners. A recorded speech of ILO Director-General Gilbert F Houngbo was played on the occasion. Earlier, the Chief Adviser distributed awards among the winners in essay, news report and photography competitions. He also distributed cheques of financial assistance to families of five workers.","govt commit ensur fair recognit protect worker ca","chief advis professor muhammad yunu say governmentern commit ensur fair recognit worker social protect say speak function thursdai bangladeshchina friendship exhibit center mark histor mai dai nation occup health safeti dai reiter interim governmenternment’ firm determin build new bangladesh chief advis professor muhammad yunu urg worker owner work togeth build new bangladesh new bangladesh build condit worker remain old bangladesh say prof yunu say aspir build new bangladesh respons time big opportun note aspir creat countri past highlight propos labour reform commiss say will quit imposs build new bangladesh without implement propos chief advis stress implement recommend labour reform commiss need accomplish immedi late will start work implement hard propos say ad start journei will continu labour employ advis brigadi gener retd dr be sakhawat hussain labour reform commiss chairman sy sultan uddin ahm countri director intern labour organ ilo bangladesh tuomo poutiainen among other speak function labour employ secretari ahm shafiquzzaman chair nativeclick ad mention build new bangladesh respons prof yunu say report labour reform commiss prepar involv stakehold nation wai implement recommend commiss build new bangladesh say base new bangladesh will establish propos commiss implement recal histori histor mai dai prof yunu say context juli upris mai dai come nation new messag also rememb respect sacrif live establish right labour work peopl worker martyr juli upris say bangladesh implement road map ilo nation plan european union point labour action plan u governmentern prof yunu say ensur welfar worker interim governmentern take variou initi includ step amend labour act chief advis also highlight variou governmenternment’ initi take ensur welfar labour protect right say labour unrest significantli reduc consult worker owner record speech ilo directorgener gilbert f houngbo plai occas early chief advis distribut award among winner essai new report photographi competit also distribut chequ financi assist famili five worker"

Sramik Dal President Anwar Hossain presided over the rally. Tarique said BNP believes state reforms and elections are equally important, adding the current interim government, despite its legitimate mandate, cannot be an alternative for an elected government. The government must outline its long-term and short-term reform plans, and draft a specific roadmap for holding the next general election only after implementing the necessary reforms. The necessary reforms could be reforms in the law enforcement agencies, the judiciary, and the Election Commission, he suggested. Then, the BNP senior leader referred to the ‘rumours’ that the interim government has granted a humanitarian corridor to Myanmar’s conflict-ridden Rakhine state for aid delivery from Bangladesh. The government did not inform the general people about such a sensitive issue, nor did it feel the need to hold consultations with political parties, which represent the people, over the matter. He declined to start a debate over whether the government can take such decisions without informing the public. But the decision must come from a national parliament elected by the people.

Air India, which has a 26.5% market share in India, flies to Europe, the United States and Canada, often crossing Pakistan's airspace. It operates many more long-haul routes than bigger domestic rival IndiGo. Data from Cirium Ascend shows IndiGo, Air India and its budget unit Air India Express had roughly 1,200 flights combined from New Delhi scheduled for Europe, the Middle East and North America in April. The move, announced by Pakistan is projected to increase operational costs by around Rs 307 crore monthly due to longer flight durations and higher fuel consumption. Air India expects to face around $600 million in additional costs if a ban from Pakistan's airspace lasts for a year, and has asked the federal government to compensate it for the hit.

Trump told his Cabinet on Wednesday that falling cargo flows showed China would soon need to engage. Trump said he was confident he’d speak with Xi. The United States has approached China seeking talks over President Donald Trump's 145% tariffs, potentially signalling Beijing's openness to negotiations. U.S. officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, also expressed hope for progress in easing trade tensions.

In a post on social media, Trump thanked Waltz for his work and said he would be temporarily replaced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who will continue as America's top diplomat. Waltz had faced criticism for mistakenly adding a journalist to a chat group where sensitive military plans were discussed - a political embarrassment likely to feature during confirmation hearings for the UN post. The former Florida congressman is the first senior member of the administration to leave the White House in Trump's second term.

It marks the second time Israel has struck Syria in as many days, following through on a promise to defend the minority group, which was involved in sectarian violence against Sunni gunmen earlier this week. The Druze adhere to a faith that is an offshoot of Islam and have followers in Syria, Lebanon and Israel. The strikes reflect Israel's deep mistrust of the Sunni Islamists who toppled Bashar al-Assad in December, posing a further challenge to interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa's efforts to establish control over the fractured nation. ""Israel struck last night near the presidential palace in Damascus,"" Netanyahu said in a joint statement with Defense Minister Israel Katz.

According to NIA sources, the conspiracy behind the terror attack that killed 26 people, primarily tourists, was developed within LeT, allegedly under directives issued by senior ISI operatives. The plan is believed to have been formalised at Lashkar's headquarters in Pakistan. Two terrorists central to the attack, identified as Hashmi Musa (alias Suleman) and Ali Bhai (alias Talha Bhai), are confirmed Pakistani nationals. Interrogations of detained operatives indicate that both attackers maintained consistent communication with Pakistani-based handlers, receiving specific instructions on timing, logistics, and execution. The terrorists allegedly entered Indian territory weeks before the attack and were aided by a network of Over Ground Workers (OGWs) who provided local logistical support, including shelter, navigation, and reconnaissance. The NIA has conducted extensive forensic and electronic data gathering. Over 40 cartridges recovered from the crime scene have been sent for ballistic and chemical analysis. Investigators also performed 3D mapping of the attack site and extracted dump data from mobile towers around the valley. Satellite phone activity in the region spiked in the days leading up to the attack. At least three satellite phones were operational in and around Baisaran, and signals from two have been traced and analysed. In total, over 2,800 individuals have been questioned by the NIA and security agencies. As of May 2, more than 150 persons remain in custody for further interrogation. These include both suspected OGWs and individuals with links to banned groups like Jamaat-e-Islami and various factions of the Hurriyat Conference. Raids have been carried out in multiple districts, including Kupwara, Pulwama, Sopore, Anantnag, and Baramulla.

In an interview with Russian state news agency RIA, Zamir Kabulov said the recent decision of the Supreme Court to suspend the ban on the activities of the Taliban was a result of “long and meticulous” work. “The Supreme Court's decision has removed the obstacles to establishing a full-fledged partnership with Kabul, including in countering the terrorist threat,” Kabulov said.

Asked if Russia is ready to officially recognize the Taliban government in Afghanistan, Kabulov said cooperation between Moscow and Kabul continued de facto, and the ban’s suspension has removed all obstacles for full-scale cooperation in various sectors. “The arrival of the Afghan ambassador to Moscow will put an end to this issue.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and opposition leader Peter Dutton have cast their vote, ABC News reported. The voting will close at 6 pm local time (0800GMT). Earlier on Saturday morning, the polling began at 8 am local time (2200GMT Friday) where more than 18 million Australians are registered to cast ballots under the country’s compulsory voting system. The Australian Electoral Commission said 4.8 million had already voted early by Thursday. Ballots will be counted immediately, but results may not be declared on election night, especially in close contests. Postal votes will be tallied in the following days. The center-left Labor Party, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, is seeking a second term after securing a narrow majority in 2022. NativeClick Ads The main challenger is the center-right Liberal-National Coalition, now led by Peter Dutton. If neither bloc secures 76 seats in the 150-member House of Representatives, the country may again see a minority government, a scenario last seen in 2010. Half of the Senate's 76 seats are also up for grabs. Economic issues have dominated the campaign, with inflation, rising living costs, and housing affordability taking center stage. Political analyst Nathan Fioritti noted that both major parties have struggled to offer substantial solutions. “Support may shift toward smaller players like the Greens, who are proposing more transformative policies,” he said. Fioritti predicted a similar pattern to 2022 when Labor and the Coalition each secured roughly 30% of the vote. “There is growing frustration with the political status quo,” he said. Amid that backdrop, independents and minor parties, particularly the progressive Greens and ""Teal"" independents, could again become power brokers. Seven Teal MPs currently hold seats, having unseated the Liberals in traditionally safe districts by focusing on climate policy and transparency. Campaigns like the Muslim Vote movement are also targeting key marginal seats, especially in response to Australia’s perceived stance on the onslaught in the Gaza Strip. “The issue could influence voters sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, potentially affecting the formation of a minority government,” said Fioritti. While domestic challenges dominate, international concerns are also influencing voter sentiment. US President Donald Trump’s second term has brought unpredictability to global affairs, prompting voters to weigh which party could best manage the Australia-US alliance. Still, experts believe the Trump factor remains a background concern compared to economic matters. “Trump’s shadow is present but not central,” said Charles Miller from the Australian National University. On foreign relations, both major parties are expected to continue Australia’s strategic alignment with the US, while cautiously engaging China on trade. “A softer approach to the US is expected, regardless of the outcome,” said Miller. Voting in Australia is compulsory, with non-participation fined Australian dollars $20 ($13). Since its introduction in 1924, voter turnout has consistently exceeded 90%, making Australia one of the highest-participating democracies in the world.","poll underwai australia elect next pm","australia’ feder elect underwai million cast vote across countri tough contest expect rule centerleft labor parti opposit centerright liberaln coalit prime minist anthoni albanes opposit leader peter dutton cast vote abc new report vote will close prime minist local time gmt early saturdai morn poll begin local time gmt fridai million australian regist cast ballot country’ compulsori vote system australian elector commiss say million alreadi vote earli thursdai ballot will count immedi result mai declar elect night especi close contest postal vote will talli follow dai centerleft labor parti lead prime minist anthoni albanes seek 2 term secur narrow major nativeclick ad main challeng centerright liberaln coalit now lead peter dutton neither bloc secur seat member hous repres countri mai see minor governmentern scenario last see half senat seat also grab econom issu domin campaign inflat rise live cost hous afford take center stage polit analyst nathan fioritti note major parti struggl offer substanti solut support mai shift toward small player like green propos transform polici say fioritti predict similar pattern labor coalit secur roughli vote grow frustrat polit statu quo say amid backdrop independ minor parti particularli progress green teal independ becom power broke seven teal mp current hold seat unseat liber tradition safe district focus climat polici transpar campaign like muslim vote movement also target kei margin seat especi respons australia’ perceiv stanc onslaught gaza strip issu influenc voter sympathet palestinian caus potenti affect format minor governmentern say fioritti domest challeng domin intern concern also influenc voter sentiment u presid donald trump 2 term bring unpredict global affair prompt voter weigh parti good manag australiau allianc still expert believ trump factor remain background concern compar econom matter trump shadow present central say charl miller australian nation univers foreign relat major parti expect continu australia’ strateg align u cautious engag china trade soft approach u expect regardless outcom say miller vote australia compulsori nonparticip fine australian dollar sinc introduct voter turnout consist exceed make australia on highestparticip democraci world"

Anthony Albanese is going to become the Australian prime minister again. He is the first prime minister to win a second consecutive three-year term in 21 years. Opposition leader Peter Dutton conceded defeat in Saturday's election, saying, “We didn't do well enough during this campaign, that much is obvious tonight, and I accept full responsibility for that.” Official vote counting won't conclude for days, but Albanese's centre-left government is set to dramatically increase its majority after the Liberal-National coalition suffered a thumping defeat nationwide. Coalition leader Peter Dutton – who lost his own seat of 24 years – said he accepted full responsibility for his party's loss and apologised to his MPs. Labor has seen swings towards them in almost every area across the country – a rare feat for a second-term government in Australia - and Albanese becomes the first prime minister to win back-to-back elections in over 20 years.

Labor is on track to finish with 86 seats, the Coalition with 39, and the Greens Party with one or two, according to projections by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).

On Saturday, the premier reiterated that Pakistan had always condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Shehbaz expressed his gratitude to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for his strong statement that supported Pakistan during the prevailing situation in South Asia as well as his call for peace in the region. The prime minister emphasised that India had failed to share any evidence and was falsely trying to link Pakistan to the Pahalgam incident, the statement said. The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe. Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to the military. As Pakistan, in the early hours of Wednesday, said it expected an Indian incursion within 24–36 hours, diplomatic channels have been engaged to prevent conflict. The prime minister also highlighted that Pakistan had rendered great sacrifices in its counter-terrorism efforts, including 90,000 casualties and over $152 billion in economic losses over the years.

The Sudanese Foreign Ministry confirmed the information on Saturday (May 3). A ministry statement said the attacks occurred over the past two days and accused the RSF of committing “crimes against humanity,” with the killings “carried out on an ethnic basis.” The ministry also reiterated its call for the United Nations Security Council and other international actors to end what it called “leniency” toward the RSF’s actions.

The revolution it represents isn’t a moment in time—it’s a frontline that must be defended every single day,” he said. “The forces that opposed July haven’t disappeared. They are watching. Waiting. Preparing to pounce,” the press secretary said in a statement posted on his verified Facebook account on Saturday (May 3) night. He said it is now a battle between two visions of Bangladesh. One aspires to a democratic, free, and progressive nation, while the other is a kleptocratic, dynastic, Chetonazi regime clinging to the ghosts of its corrupt past, Alam said. “And make no mistake: the moment you relax, the moment you think the fight is over, they reappear—with violence, with propaganda, with venom,” he added. The press secretary said the anti-July forces have their “Laspensers”—those loyal scribes and spin doctors—eager to rewrite history and undermine July’s achievements. “They wait for the streets to empty so they can reclaim them. But I’ve learned: we must never leave the streets. Not just the physical streets, but the ideological ones too,” he said. NativeClick Ads Alam said the greatest challenge in any post-revolutionary moment is to defend the truth. “Because if you don’t, your opponents will gladly replace it with their fiction.

I won’t stop speaking about the massacres of July. “I won’t stop telling the truth about the long, dark years between 2009 and August 2024—a time of digital slavery, repression, and fear,” the press secretary said. He said the fight for a New Bangladesh is not just political but it is personal too. “It’s existential. It will shape the rest of my life.

Piles are sitting one after the other on the banks of the Dhaleswari and Buriganga. According to sources, the Panchabati-Muktarpur road has been modernized from the Panchabati intersection to six lanes for 310 meters on both sides of Fatulla and Narayanganj for easy communication with the capital city of Munshiganj district. And from Kashipur to Shitalakshya-3 bridge is on two-storied two lanes. The old road is widened with two more lanes up to Shitalakshya-3 point in Char Sayedpur. The 3.75 km road from the roundabout of the bridge to Muktarpur bridge is a four-lane road. After the project is 100 percent completed, new possibilities for communication will be opened on this road, avoiding traffic jams, said Moniruzzaman Monir, deputy assistant engineer of the project. The project is being implemented with the own funding of GOB and Bangladesh Bridge Authority. So far, 60 percent of the project has been completed. The project was approved in the ECNEC meeting in 2020.","muktarpurpanchabati doubledeck road set becom visibl","muchanticip muktarpurpanchabati doubledeck road build make commun munshiganj district capit dhaka easy fast work road progress rapid speed involv project sai entir work will complet end work complet door dream will open longstand traffic jam endless suffer will come end complet construct work time work instal desk slab doubledeck road current underwai infrastructur doubledeck road becom visibl due relentless effort involv project accord expert involv project panchabatimuktarpur road modern work gain special momentum complet km long project worth tk crore june next year widen old road construct new doubledeck road go simultan pile sit on bank dhaleswari buriganga accord sourc panchabatimuktarpur road modern panchabati intersect six lane meter side fatulla narayanganj easi commun capit citi munshiganj district kashipur shitalakshya bridg twostori two lane old road widen two lane shitalakshya point char sayedpur km road roundabout bridg muktarpur bridg fourlan road project percent complet new possibl commun will open road avoid traffic jam say moniruzzaman monir deputi assist engin project project implement fund gob bangladesh bridg author far percent project complet project approv ecnec meet"

The meeting, scheduled for this afternoon by the Greek Presidency, was convened at Islamabad’s request. Pakistan’s foreign office announced on May 4 that it would update the UN on regional developments following, including India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty.

Permanent Representative of Greece to the UN and President of the Security Council for the month Ambassador Evangelos Sekeris had earlier condemned the Pahalgam terror attack, in which 26 people - mostly tourists - were killed. “This is a position of principle. We condemn terrorism in all its forms, everywhere it is happening. On the other hand, we are concerned about this tension which is mounting in the region,” news agency PTI quoted him as saying.

The plan has already received an in-principle approval. Once sanctioned, it will be a shot in the arm for the force that has heightened vigil in the east following last year’s fall of the Sheikh Hasina government in Bangladesh and in the wake of a renewed challenge on the Pakistan front after the April 22 Pahalgam massacre. The BSF is soon expected to get the final sanction for raising 16 new battalions which will be raised over the next few years, sources in the security establishment told PTI. Some final approvals including sanction from the Union finance ministry are pending and are expected to be granted soon, they said. The paramilitary force has 193 battalions as of now to guard the two fronts. A battalion of the border force consists of over 1,000 troopers. Hence, the overall strength of the 16 new battalions will be around 17,000 personnel. These new battalions will help the BSF in its primary task of guarding the Pakistan and Bangladesh borders as per a blueprint being prepared by the border force, they said. The sources said two field command bases for the force have also been approved by the Union home ministry. One sector will come up in Jammu to strengthen security along the India-Pakistan International Border in Jammu and Punjab and the second will be based in Mizoram for better surveillance of the Bangladesh border, they said. NativeClick Ads The current sectors, headed by deputy inspector general (DIG) rank officers, in its Jammu frontier are located at Rajouri, Sunderbani, Jammu and Indreshwar Nagar. Under its Mizoram and Cachar frontier headquartered in Assam, the sectors are located at Silchar, Aizawl and one in Manipur. Sources said the BSF will initiate recruitment drives to hire men and women for these new battalions, followed by their training. The force is expected to raise these units over a period of five to six years, they added. According to officials, the 2.70 lakh personnel strong force had sent a proposal to the home ministry a few years ago to raise 20-21 new battalions owing to “the fast-changing security dynamics, profile of the terrain and related issues” in its primary task area of guarding the two borders apart from combat duties in the anti-Naxal operations theatre. The government finally agreed to raise 16 new battalions, they said. The BSF guards a total of 6,726 km of the two borders which includes 2,290 km of the India-Pakistan International Border and 339 km along the Line of Control (LoC) apart from 4,097 km of the front with Bangladesh. A total of around 1,047 km of these two borders is unfenced owing to those lines passing through riverine areas and harsh jungle terrain. The force has 1,760 border posts along these two frontiers.

Md Jahangir Alam Chowdhury (retd) has said Italy is keen to take more Bangladeshi workers. The adviser said this while talking to newsmen after a meeting with Interior Minister of Italy Matteo Piantedosi held at the ministry’s conference room on Monday. The adviser assured Italian minister of extending cooperation to return illegal Bangladeshi nationals under mutually agreed framework. “The Italy government will take generous initiatives to legalize Bangladeshi nationals staying in Italy,” he hoped. In addition, he said, the two countries are poised to sign a declaration establishing the Joint Committee on Promoting Cooperation in Preventing and Combating Transnational Organized Crimes and the proposed Agreement on Cooperation in Security Matters. The initiatives are intended to strengthen our collaboration based on mutual understanding, respect, and shared commitment, he said. “We are aware that a significant number of Bangladeshi nationals have entered Italy through different channels, and we fully recognize the challenges faces by the Italian government,” he said. Jahangir continued that many of these individuals began their journey with valid documentation. But sometimes they face exploitation and misinformation, particularly during secondary movements through transit countries. NativeClick Ads The Government of Bangladesh remains steadfast in addressing these challenges through a comprehensive, multi-pronged strategy, he said, adding that this strategy is underpinned by three core principles- law enforcement, education, and protection of human rights. The adviser said Bangladesh government has developed a robust legal framework aimed at combating human trafficking. In line with this, Bangladesh has established the Trafficking in Human Beings (THB) Unit, dedicated to investigating trafficking-related crimes. Italy can help to strengthen Bangladesh Police, Bangladesh Borger Guard (BGB), Bangladesh Coast guard and other security agencies through exchange of training and other capacity development initiatives, he said.

A recent report of Indian newspaper The Hindu published on the World Press Freedom Day claiming the Prof Yunus-led Bangladesh government has targeted 640 journalists in eight months is fake, it said in a Facebook post on its verified account - CA Press Wing Facts. ""Allegations by the Rights and Risks Analysis Group (RRAG) published in The Hindu, that Bangladesh's Interim Government has targeted 640 journalists, are a wildly misleading piece of disinformation,"" it said. Since the Bangladeshis overthrew the brutal and corrupt regime of Sheikh Hasina's Awami League, many journalists perceived to have been linked to the regime have come under pressure from various quarters. Many have faced legal charges made possible by the flaws in the justice system deliberately created by the Awami League and now being corrected under the interim government, according to the statement. ""It is entirely untrue that the interim government itself has targeted journalists. On the contrary, the Chief Adviser, a Nobel Peace Laureate, and his Press Secretary, formerly an AFP bureau chief in Dhaka, among many others in the interim government, have been recognised for decades as champions of press freedom,"" it said. The press wing claimed that the RRAG, led by Suhas Chakma, on the contrary, is known to support the Awami League and has frequently spread disinformation about Bangladesh since Hasina's overthrow by the people of Bangladesh on August 5 last. RRAG played a central role in spreading inflated claims about the September 2024 violence in Bangladesh's Chittagong Hill Tracts. NativeClick Ads While credible Bangladeshi media confirmed four deaths in three incidents across Khagrachari and Rangamati, RRAG claimed nine indigenous people were killed - a figure unsupported by independent investigations.

Merz, 69, who led his conservatives to a federal election victory in February and has signed a coalition deal with the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), won 325 votes, nine more than needed for an absolute majority, in the secret ballot. He had secured just 310 votes in the first round of voting, meaning at least 18 coalition lawmakers failed to back him.

The collateral damage, Indian government sources said, was “minimised through precision targeting”. No Pakistani military installations were hit, they stressed. Sources in the government said Indian intelligence had cited clear evidence of the Pakistan Army’s logistical support to terror groups. The strikes aimed to expose and dismantle this deep-rooted nexus between the military and cross-border terrorism, they said. Government sources said that while global powers had urged both sides to exercise restraint, India has received support for its right to self-defence.

Such actions are in contravention of the UN Charter, international law, and established norms governing inter-state relations,” the ministry said in a statement.

Director General of Inter-Services Public Relations (DG ISPR) has strongly condemned India’s latest aggression, labelling it a “cowardly and disgraceful” attack on innocent civilians. According to DG ISPR, the Indian Army violated the ceasefire agreement along the Line of Control (LoC) during the night of the 6th and 7th, resulting in the martyrdom of 31 civilians and injuries to at least 57 others. He said that instead of fighting Pakistan’s army, Indian forces purposely attacked innocent men, women, and children. He called this a cowardly act and proof of India’s lack of morals. DG ISPR also asked if the young children who were killed were the “terrorists” India claimed to be targeting. Highlighting India’s hypocrisy, he revealed that the Indian military also targeted mosques and even desecrated copies of the Holy Quran during the assault. “Which religion or principle of humanity allows the bombing of places of worship?” he asked. In contrast, DG ISPR confirmed that Pakistan’s response was strictly focused on military targets. The Pakistan Air Force displayed exceptional professionalism by destroying Indian military positions and aircraft, including three Rafale Jets, one SU-30, and one MiG-29, without harming civilians. He also revealed that the attack occurred while international media delegations were touring locations that India falsely accused of harbouring militants. “India launched this strike out of fear that its propaganda would be exposed,” he said. At the time of the attack, 57 commercial aircraft, including those from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, China, and South Korea, were airborne in Pakistani airspace.

Leaves of all police personnel have been cancelled and public gatherings restricted as local authorities gear up for any escalation from the Pakistan side. Rajasthan, which shares a 1,037-km border with Pakistan, is on high alert. The border has been completely sealed and Border Security Force personnel have been given shoot-on-sight orders if they spot any suspicious activity. Authorities in Rajasthan have also restricted movement near the border for those who don’t live there. The Indian Air Force is on high alert. Flight movement from Jodhpur, Kishangarh and Bikaner airports has been suspended till May 9 as fighter jets patrol the skies in the western sector. Missile defence systems are activated, it is learnt. Sukhoi-30 MKI jets are conducting air patrols from Ganganagar to the Rann of Kutch. Schools in Bikaner, Sri Ganganagar, Jaisalmer, and Barmer districts have been shut and ongoing exams have been postponed. Leaves of cops and Railways staff have been cancelled. Border villages are on high alert and evacuation plans are in place for emergency response. Anti-drone systems near the border have also been activated. For Jaisalmer and Jodhpur, orders for blackout from midnight to 4 am have been issued. Blackouts create problems for advanced high-speed aircraft, making it difficult for enemy pilots to strike. In Punjab, the leaves of all police personnel have been cancelled and public gatherings have been restricted. Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann has also cancelled all government programmes because of the tension on the border. India yesterday carried out 24 missile strikes to destroy terror infrastructure at nine locations in Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir. The strike, codenamed Operation Sindoor, was a response to the Pahalgam terror attack in which 26 innocents were shot dead in cold blood.

Vance has said that the conflict between India and Pakistan is “fundamentally none of our business,” though he and President Donald Trump are encouraging both the countries to de-escalate. “What we can do is try to encourage these folks to de-escalate a little bit, but we’re not going to get involved in the middle of war that’s fundamentally none of our business and has nothing to do with America’s ability to control it. You know, America can’t tell the Indians to lay down their arms. We can't tell the Pakistanis to lay down their arms. And so, we’re going to continue to pursue this thing through diplomatic channels,” Vance, who has been a proponent of US disengagement from international conflicts, said in an interview with Fox News. “Our hope and our expectation is that this is not going to spiral into a broader regional war or, God forbid, a nuclear conflict,” Vance added. “Right now, we don’t think that’s going to happen.” The remarks by Vance came as Pakistan made a failed attempt to attack military establishment in Jammu, Pathankot and several other cities.

It would be a miracle if Asia Cup, which is supposed to be hosted by India (at a supposedly neutral venue), goes ahead given the raging conflict which was triggered by the killing of 26 people in a terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam. The nearly non-existent sporting ties are unlikely to resume at any level till tensions ease. The Asia Cup was given a 19-day window in September where at least two Indo-Pak matches were to take place apart from the possibility of a final clash between the bitter rivals which would have assured the broadcasters of high advertising revenue. “It is extremely bad optics if cricket continues when there is a possibility of war with a rogue nation (Pakistan). Sports can continue when everything is normal. Plus it is very natural for foreign players and coaches to be wary and wanting to return home,” a senior BCCI official told PTI on condition of anonymity after the league was suspended indefinitely on Friday. Incidentally, the Asian Cricket Council is now headed by Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Mohsin Naqvi and the onus will be on him to deal with financial losses that the Asia Cup cancellation would cause. It is understood that the BCCI top brass' decision to suspend the league was well thought out call as only a handful of matches are left which can be completed in a 10-day window with possible double-headers.

"science-technology","https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/112247","Driving change thru’ private initiatives in agriculture, water access","10/05/2025","The role of private enterprises in improving the quality of life at the grassroots level of the country is increasing. Along with sustainable development, private organizations are coming forward in various ways for social welfare. Experts say that most private organizations are not only fulfilling their social responsibilities but are also genuinely committed to the welfare of society, a development that is highly encouraging for the country. Due to a lack of knowledge about technology and modern farming methods, many farmers in Bangladesh remain underdeveloped. The farmers of the country are lagging behind due to lack of knowledge about technology and modern methods. Despite working hard, they have to face losses. This has an impact on the rural society. Negative impact brings poverty. Addressing this concern, one of the leading private banks in the country, Standard Chartered Bangladesh, has taken initiatives in the northern region. Last year, the bank began training for 11,000 farmers across six districts of northern Bangladesh in environmentally friendly modern agricultural practices. Arranged through a local organization, the training took place in Bogura, Joypurhat, Sirajganj, Natore, Pabna and Rajshahi. Farmers were introduced to various modern farming technologies through this program. It not only increased productivity but also helped improve their standard of living. Several private initiatives are complementing government efforts to tackle the crisis of access to safe drinking water. Notably, the telecommunications company Robi has launched an impressive initiative to ensure the availability of drinking water in transit areas. Water plants have been installed at major railway stations, including Kamalapur, Dhaka Airport, Chattogram, Sylhet, Khulna, Rajshahi, Mymensingh, Mohanganj, Feni and Cumilla. These installations allow passers-by to easily access safe drinking water. Robi implemented this initiative in collaboration with Bangladesh Railway and the non-governmental organization WaterAid. This has particularly benefited homeless children and marginalized groups, protecting them from waterborne diseases caused by consuming contaminated water. Private efforts are also being made to deliver safe water to rural communities. Under an initiative by BAT Bangladesh, 48 out of 126 water purification plants have been installed in Kushtia district alone. These plants have been set up in Kushtia Sadar, Mirpur, Daulatpur, Kumarkhali and Bheramara upazilas. As a result, thousands of farmers and their families are gaining access to clean water, protecting them from waterborne diseases and arsenic contamination. In addition to ensuring safe water, BAT Bangladesh has also launched extensive tree plantation campaigns with the participation of local farmers in Kushtia. As part of this initiative, notable afforestation efforts have been carried out around the Lalon Shah Bridge, Kushtia Bypass Road, Kushtia-Jashore Highway and the GK Canal areas. Across the region, the impact of these efforts is visibly significant. It is worth mentioning that the organization has distributed over 130 million tree saplings across the country since 1980. Beyond safe water and environmental conservation, private initiatives are also working to ensure that farmers have easy access to credit. Syngenta Bangladesh is actively working to provide farmers with loans under flexible and farmer-friendly terms and is undertaking various initiatives for agricultural development. Simultaneously, the Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture is striving to bring long-term structural changes in the country’s food and nutrition systems. Professor Dr. Atikul Islam from the Department of Economics at Rajshahi University said, ‘The initiatives taken by private organizations for grassroots agriculture and environmental protection are certainly commendable. It is essential that their efforts are backed by thorough and appropriate research, ensuring not only benefits for the grassroots people but also long-lasting solutions to their problems.’","drive chang thru privat initi agricultur water access","role privat enterpris improv qualiti life grassroot level countri increas along sustain develop privat organ come forward variou wai social welfar expert sai privat organ fulfil social respons also genuin commit welfar societi develop highli encourag countri due lack knowledg technologi modern farm method mani farmer bangladesh remain underdevelop farmer countri lag behind due lack knowledg technologi modern method despit work hard face loss impact rural societi neg impact bring poverti address concern on lead privat bank countri standard charter bangladesh take initi northern region last year bank begin train farmer across six district northern bangladesh environment friendli modern agricultur practice arrang local organ train take place bogura joypurhat sirajganj nator pabna rajshahi farmer introduc variou modern farm technologi program increas product also help improv standard live sever privat initi complement governmentern effort tackl crisi access safe drink water notabl telecommun compani robi launch impress initi ensur avail drink water transit area water plant instal major railwai station includ kamalapur dhaka airport chattogram sylhet khulna rajshahi mymensingh mohanganj feni cumilla instal allow passersbi easili access safe drink water robi implement initi collabor bangladesh railwai nongovernmenternment organ wateraid particularli benefit homeless child margin group protect waterborn diseas caus consum contamin water privat effort also make deliv safe water rural commun initi bat bangladesh water purif plant instal kushtia district alon plant set kushtia sadar mirpur daulatpur kumarkhali bheramara upazila result thousand farmer famili gain access clean water protect waterborn diseas arsen contamin addit ensur safe water bat bangladesh also launch extens tree plantat campaign particip local farmer kushtia part initi notabl afforest effort carri around lalon shah bridg kushtia bypass road kushtiajashor highwai gk canal area across region impact effort visibli signific worth mention organ distribut million tree sapl across countri sinc beyond safe water environment conserv privat initi also work ensur farmer easi access credit syngenta bangladesh activ work provid farmer loan flexibl farmerfriendli term undertak variou initi agricultur develop simultan syngenta foundat sustain agricultur strive bring longterm structur chang country’ food nutrit system professor dr atikul islam depart econom rajshahi univers say initi take privat organ grassroot agricultur environment protect certainli commend essenti effort back thorough appropri research ensur benefit grassroot peopl also longlast solut problem"

After sounds of explosions were heard in Indian-administered Kashmir, India’s Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said there had been “repeated violations of the understanding we arrived at”. A short while later, Pakistan’s foreign ministry said it remained “committed to faithful implementation of a ceasefire...notwithstanding the violations being committed by India in some areas”. The fighting between India and Pakistan over the last four days has been the worst military confrontation between the two rivals in decades. The use of drones, missiles and artillery started when India struck targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in response to a deadly militant attack in Pahalgam last month. Pakistan had denied any involvement. After four days of cross-border strikes, India and Pakistan said they had agreed on a full and immediate ceasefire.

""This is a breach of the understanding arrived at earlier today."" Misri said India's armed forces was ""giving an appropriate response"" and he concluded his briefing by ""calling upon Pakistan to address these violations"". In response, a spokesman for Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: ""Pakistan remains committed to faithful implementation of ceasefire between Pakistan and India, announced earlier today. ""Notwithstanding the violations being committed by India in some areas, our forces are handling the situation with responsibility and restraint. ""We believe that any issues in smooth implementation of the ceasefire should be addressed through communication at appropriate levels. ""The troops on ground should also exercise restraint."" Kashmir is claimed in full by India and Pakistan, but administered only in part by each since they were partitioned following independence from Britain in 1947. It has been a flashpoint between the two nuclear-armed nations and they have fought two wars over it. Confirming the ceasefire, India's external affairs minister S Jaishankar said the two nations had ""worked out an understanding on stoppage of firing and military action"". ""India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It will continue to do so,"" he added. Later, in an address to the nation, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the ceasefire had been reached ""for the benefit of everybody"". Speaking after the ceasefire announcement, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said India and Pakistan had agreed to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site.

The prison houses nearly 5,000 inmates, it added. Meanwhile, government spokesperson Information Minister Khalid Al-Aiser said: “What happened at El-Obeid prison is a full-fledged war crime, adding to the long record of violations committed by the militia and its backers against Sudanese civilians.” The incident came amid ongoing drone attacks on Port Sudan, the country’s temporary administrative capital in the east, for the seventh consecutive day. Eyewitnesses told Anadolu that drones attacked Port Sudan at dawn on Saturday and were met with anti-aircraft fire. The attack followed a similar drone strike on Friday, marking the seventh day of such assaults, which were also repelled by Sudanese army air defenses. Since Sunday, Port Sudan, the country’s temporary capital, has been under repeated drone strikes targeting both civilian and military sites, triggering fires at oil depots and a power station. NativeClick Ads On Tuesday, Sudanese authorities accused the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) of being behind the drone strikes on fuel depots at the southern port, the Port Sudan Airport, and a local power facility. The RSF has not commented on the allegations. Since April 2023, the RSF has been battling the army for control of Sudan, resulting in thousands of deaths and creating one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. More than 20,000 people have been killed and 15 million displaced, according to the UN and local authorities. Research from US scholars, however, puts the death toll at around 130,000.

In a rare televised late-night address from the Kremlin, Putin said Russia was seeking “serious negotiations” aimed at “moving towards a lasting, strong peace”. Earlier on Saturday, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer travelled to Kyiv with counterparts from France, Germany and Poland to put pressure on Russia to commit to an unconditional ceasefire, starting Monday. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov later said Moscow would “have to think this through” - but warned that “trying to pressure us is quite useless”. In his own statement, Putin said he could “not rule out” the possibility that the talks could result in Russia and Ukraine agreeing “a new truce”. But he did not address calls for a 30-day ceasefire directly. The Russian leader said the proposed talks should be held in the Turkish city of Istanbul, as they have been before, and that he would speak to Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday to discuss the details. Kyiv has not responded to the invitation.

Alam said this ban was necessary to protect national security and sovereignty, ensure the safety of July Movement activists, and safeguard plaintiffs and witnesses of the International Crimes Tribunal. “We have seen that entire political parties -- not just their activities -- have been banned even in western democracies for crimes against humanity and for acting against core national interests,” he said. Germany and Italy banned Nazi and fascist parties after the Second World War (WW2), the press secretary said, adding that in Spain and Belgium, some political parties were banned for secessionist activities. He mentioned that the UNHCHR report demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that AL, its leadership and partymen, and its affiliated organisations participated in heinous crimes against humanity. Moreover, he said, this party caused wholesale destruction of democracy and the electoral process in Bangladesh.

The decision comes ahead of President Donald Trump’s visit to the Middle East on Tuesday. Hamas said it was also intended to facilitate a deal for the entry of humanitarian aid. Gaza has been under an Israeli blockade for 70 days. Earlier a senior Hamas official said that the Palestinian armed group was holding direct negotiations with a US administration official in Qatar. The Israeli prime minister’s office said it had been informed by the US of the Hamas intention to release Alexander. A senior Palestinian official familiar with the negotiations said that Hamas’s announcement was intended as a goodwill gesture before Trump’s arrival. He said another meeting between Hamas and the mediators was scheduled for early Monday morning to finalise the process of Edan’s release, which would require a temporary halt to Israeli military activity and a suspension of aerial operations during the handover. President Trump confirmed Alexander’s release in a post on Truth Social, calling it “monumental news” and “a step taken in good faith”. Born in Tel Aviv but raised in New Jersey, 21-year-old Alexander was serving in an elite infantry unit on the border with Gaza when he was captured by Hamas militants during the 7 October attack.

In its statement, Hamas said the release was part of efforts to achieve a ceasefire and allow food, medicine and other supplies into Gaza - which has been under a complete blockade by Israel for 70 days.

According to Lt Gen Chaudhry, it was only after Pakistan had executed its retaliatory campaign under ‘Operation Bunyan-un-Marsoos’ that Islamabad responded to Indian overtures. “So on May 10, after the response and retribution […] and on the request and intervention of international interlocutors, we responded to the already made request of the Indians.” He also addressed viral claims circulating on social media about an Indian pilot allegedly being captured by Pakistani forces. “I want to categorically state that Pakistan has no Indian pilot in custody,” he said, attributing the reports to “social media chatter” and disinformation campaigns. “This is all part of fake news and propaganda that has been generated from multiple sources.” Highlighting the high stakes of escalation between two nuclear-armed neighbours, DG ISPR called the idea of war between India and Pakistan “inconceivable” and “sheer stupidity.” “In a conflict between two rival nuclear powers … such a conflict is actually an absurdity,” he said, adding, “In the case of India and Pakistan, such a conflict can lead to peril of more than 1.6 billion people.” He added, “In reality, there is no space for war between India and Pakistan, and if anyone wants to carve out this space for war, he is actually carving out the space for mutual annihilation.” Despite provocations, Lt Gen Chaudhry stated that Pakistan had acted with strategic maturity throughout the conflict. He said the response to Indian aggression was carefully managed to avoid uncontrolled escalation, while still delivering a “two-notch” higher reply using conventional military forces. NativeClick Ads DG ISPR described Pakistan’s 'Operation Bunyan-un-Marsoos' against India as a comprehensive national response to Indian aggression, stating that the armed forces had fulfilled every promise made to the nation.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer made the joint statement public during a press briefing in Geneva.

His decision comes before this summer’s five-Test tour of England, which starts on 20 June, and follows captain Rohit Sharma’s retirement on Wednesday. Kohli, 36, has played 123 Tests for India and scored 9,230 runs at an average of 46.85. ""It's been 14 years since I first wore the baggy blue in Test cricket,"" Kohli posted on social media. ""Honestly, I never imagined the journey this format would take me on. It's tested me, shaped me, and taught me lessons I'll carry for life."" Kohli retired from T20 internationals in 2024, after India's World Cup victory, but is expected to continue playing one-day internationals. After making his Test debut against West Indies in 2011, Kohli went on to captain India in 68 of his Tests, with his 40 wins in charge making him the country's most successful leader in the format.

The probe revealed that a powerful syndicate—comprising 11 international airlines, their General Sales Agents (GSAs), and at least 30 travel agencies—systematically manipulated the ticketing system, particularly on Middle East-bound routes. The nine-member investigation committee, formed by the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism, found that GSAs—especially those representing airlines of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, and Jajeera Air—established a monopoly over ticket distribution by Mr. Ahmed Yousuf Walid of Galaxy group who rule over at least 70% market share of Saudi Arabian points and middle east. By bypassing standard procedures, these GSAs facilitated preferential ticket allocation to select agencies, violating the permitted 7% commission cap and inflating ticket prices by 50% to 200%. The report further revealed that some travel agencies hoarded ‘block tickets’ and sold them through sub-agents at highly inflated rates. This artificial scarcity pushed ticket prices on the Dhaka–Saudi Arabia route to as high as Tk 1.9 lakh, even though the actual price should have been around Tk 50,000. The syndicate targeted Bangladeshi migrant workers—many of whom were forced to pay exorbitant prices to secure tickets for urgent overseas employment. The following agencies have been issued show-cause notices and summoned for formal hearings: Kazi Air International, Citicom International, King Air Aviation, RBC International, Mega International, Mother Love Air Travels, JS Travels & Tours, Sadia Travels, Hashem Air International, Naria Travels, Elham Corporation, and Al Ghazi Travels. Afsiya Jannat Saleh, General Secretary of the Association of Travel Agents of Bangladesh (ATAB), said, “Because of the GSA-controlled monopoly, legitimate travel agencies are denied access to tickets. Bribery and favoritism have become the norm. Unless strict action is taken, the syndicate will re-emerge.” ATAB’s complaints were among the key reasons the Civil Aviation Ministry intervened with emergency reforms. NativeClick Ads On February 11, the ministry issued a directive prohibiting ticket bookings without a passenger’s name and passport copy. As a result, many undisclosed block tickets were returned to the Global Distribution System (GDS), leading to greater transparency and a sharp drop in prices. Currently, ticket prices for the Dhaka–Saudi Arabia route have stabilized at around Tk 48,000 to Tk 50,000. Despite the exposure, critics argue that no visible punitive action has been taken against the syndicate’s masterminds. “Investigation and show-cause notices alone will not suffice,” said one stakeholder. “Without exemplary punishment, such practices will recur.”","ticket syndic loot crore taka migrant worker","highlevel governmentern investig unearth massiv ticket scam defraud bangladeshi migrant worker hundr crore taka probe reveal power syndic compris intern airlin gener sale agent gsa less travel agenc systemat manipul ticket system particularli middl eastbound rout ninememb investig committe form ministri civil aviat tourism find gsa especi repres airlin saudi arabia qatar oman jajeera air establish monopoli ticket distribut mr ahm yousuf walid galaxi group rule less market share saudi arabian point middl east bypass standard procedur gsa facilit preferenti ticket alloc select agenc violat permit commiss cap inflat ticket price report reveal travel agenc hoard block ticket sell subag highli inflat rate artifici scarciti push ticket price dhaka saudi arabia rout high tk lakh even though actual price around tk syndic target bangladeshi migrant worker mani forc pai exorbit price secur ticket urgent oversea employ follow agenc issu showcaus notic summon formal hear kazi air intern citicom intern king air aviat rbc intern mega intern mother love air travel j travel tour sadia travel hashem air intern naria travel elham corpor al ghazi travel afsiya jannat saleh gener secretari associ travel agent bangladesh atab say gsacontrol monopoli legitim travel agenc deni access ticket briberi favorit becom norm unless strict action take syndic will reemerg atab’ complaint among kei reason civil aviat ministri interven emerg reform nativeclick ad februari ministri issu direct prohibit ticket book without passenger’ name passport copi result mani undisclos block ticket return global distribut system gd lead great transpar sharp drop price current ticket price dhaka saudi arabia rout stabil around tk tk despit exposur critic argu visibl punit action take syndicate’ mastermind investig showcaus notic alon will suffic say on stakehold without exemplari punish practice will recur"

The Chief Justice made the observation on Tuesday during the hearing of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court on the appeal seeking restoration of Jamaat-e-Islami's registration. During the hearing, senior lawyer Ehsan Abdullah Siddiq represented Jamaat along with lawyers Shishir Monir. Lawyer Tawhidul Islam represented the Election Commission (EC). The hearing on Jamaat’s appeal originally began on 12 March this year but has since been deferred multiple times. On 7 May this year, the Appellate Division fixed 13 May to resume the appeal hearing on Jamaat's petition for reinstatement of its registration and electoral symbol. On 1 August 2013, the High Court declared Jamaat's registration as a political party illegal and void, following the disposal of a writ petition. Subsequently, on 7 December 2018, the EC formally cancelled the party's registration through a gazette notification. Jamaat later appealed the High Court verdict. However, in November 2023, the Appellate Division, led by then Chief Justice Obaidul Hassan, dismissed Jamaat's appeal for default as the party's principal lawyer failed to appear for the hearing. As a result, the High Court's verdict declaring Jamaat's registration illegal remained in effect. On 22 October last year, the Appellate Division revived a previously dismissed appeal by Jamaat, seeking to regain its registration as a political party.

The aim of this decision is to increase the efficiency of the country's revenue system, reduce conflicts of interest, and expand the scope of revenue collection by separating revenue policy formulation activities from revenue collection management.

The tremor occurred at a depth of 83 kilometres (52 miles) beneath the Earth’s surface, the Express Tribune reports. The US Geological Survey (USGS) reported a similar event, registering a magnitude 6.0 quake just 10 miles south of Fry, a small town in Greece, and approximately 70 miles east of Ágios Nikólaos on Crete. The quake struck just before 2:00 a.m. local time, sending tremors across the eastern Mediterranean. Despite the strong magnitude, no immediate reports of damage or injuries have been recorded in Greece. However, Greece’s Ministry for Climate Crisis and Civil Protection issued a precautionary tsunami alert, advising coastal residents to remain cautious and avoid seafront areas temporarily. In Egypt, tremors were also felt, particularly along the northern coast. The National Research Institute of Astronomy and Geophysics confirmed that a 6.4 magnitude earthquake had been recorded 431 kilometres off the Egyptian coast, though no casualties or property damage were reported.

Clashes broke out late on Monday after the killing of a major militia leader. After calming on Tuesday morning, the fighting reignited overnight, with major battles rocking districts across the entire city. ""Regular forces, in coordination with the relevant security authorities, have begun taking the necessary measures to ensure calm, including the deployment of neutral units,"" the defence ministry said. The ministry said the neutral units it was deploying around sensitive sites were from the police force, which does not carry heavy weapons. After the fighting, burned-out cars littered the streets in some areas, and nearby buildings were pocked with bullet marks. Monday's clashes had appeared to consolidate the power of Abdulhamid al-Dbeibah, prime minister of the divided country's Government of National Unity (GNU) and an ally of Turkey. However, any prolonged fighting within Tripoli risks drawing in factions from outside the capital, potentially leading to a wider escalation between Libya's many armed players after years of relative calm. The main fighting on Wednesday was between the Dbeibah-aligned 444 Brigade and the Special Deterrence Force (Rada), the last major armed Tripoli faction not currently in his camp, the English-language Libyan Observer reported._Agencies.

The prime minister accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal and Information Minister Attaullah Tarar. Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Syed Asim Munir and Chief of Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu were also present during the visit, the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) said. During the visit, the prime minister received a comprehensive briefing on the conduct of the battle and the current operational preparedness of the Corps. Addressing the personnel, he said the valiant Pakistan Armed Forces, fortified by the unwavering resolve of the nation, defended the motherland in a heroic manner and dealt a decisive blow to the adversary’s dastardly aggression. The premier said books would be written on Pakistan’s recent military success, calling it a testament to the bravery and professionalism of the armed forces. He commended the leadership and personnel of the army, navy and air force, saying they had “put the enemies of Pakistan in their place”. NativeClick Ads Taking aim at Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, PM Shehbaz said the world knows who trained Mukti Bahini in 1971. “Today, the same nexus is seen in support of groups like the BLA and TTP, and it leads back to Modi.” He rebuffed recent statements made by the Indian prime minister, saying: “Mr Modi, keep your fiery speeches to yourself. Pakistan seeks peace in the region, but do not mistake our desire for stability as weakness.” Referring to the suspension of Indus Waters Treaty, he warned India against tampering, saying: “If India even thinks of stopping Pakistan’s water, let it be known: water and blood cannot flow together,” he warned. “This is a red line we cannot compromise on.” He noted the armed forces had crushed the false sense of regional dominance harboured by India. “The illusion that India is the regional power has been shattered,” he added. The prime minister assured that Pakistan was committed to dialogue on all unresolved issues, including Kashmir dispute. However, he said: “We will not allow a one-sided approach where only sweet things are welcomed and the bitter truths ignored.” He also warned Modi that any future hostility from India would be met with a forceful and unprecedented response. “Modi, if you attempt another act of aggression, you will face consequences beyond imagination,” he added. Interacting with officers and brave men at the frontline, the premier lauded their high morale, exceptional professionalism, and unflinching readiness. “Pakistan takes immense pride in its brave sons they are the crown jewels of the nation,” he said, adding that the blatant aggression against innocent civilians resulting into martyrdom of children, women and elderly and calling them terrorists is utterly shameful and against all international laws, norms and morality. He stated that despite Pakistan’s offer of neutral investigations, India deliberately evaded such a path, as they had nothing to prove and based on a false pretext and bloated arrogance and ego, launched the offensive, “for which it has got a very befitting response”. The premier also said that the martyrs have always been ""our pride and the nation shall eternally remain indebted to them"". 'Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos' Pakistan armed forces launched a large-scale retaliatory military action, named ""Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos"" and targeted several Indian military strikes across multiple regions. The strikes, described by officials as ""precise and proportionate"", were carried out in response to India's continued aggression across the Line of Control (LoC) and within Pakistan's territory, which New Delhi claimed were aimed at ""terrorist targets"". After at least 87 hours, the war between the two nuclear-armed nations ended on May 10 with a ceasefire agreement brokered by the United States. According to ISPR, a total of 53 individuals, including 13 personnel of the armed forces and 40 civilians, were martyred in Indian strikes during the recent military confrontation. The military confrontation between the two countries was triggered by last month’s attack in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) that left 26 tourists dead, with India blaming Pakistan for the attack without offering any evidence. Islamabad denied any links to the attack and called for a neutral investigation. It said the targets hit on Wednesday were civilian sites.","aveng war shehbaz sharif","prime minist shehbaz sharif declar success oper bunyanummarsoo histor moment sai pakistan arm forc aveng war give decis power respons indian aggress geotv report histori will etern record within hour pakistan’ defend extinguish india’ unprovok aggress unmatch precis resolv say address soldier deploi frontlin area pasrur canton near sialkot prime minist accompani deputi prime minist ishaq dar defenc minist khawaja asif minist plan develop ahsan iqbal inform minist attaullah tarar chief armi staff coa gener sy asim munir chief air staff air chief marshal zaheer ahm baber sidhu also present visit inter servic public relat ispr say visit prime minist receiv comprehens brief conduct battl current oper prepare corp address personnel say valiant pakistan arm forc fortifi unwav resolv nation defend motherland heroic manner deal decis blow adversary’ dastardli aggress premier say book write pakistan’ recent militari success call testament braveri profession arm forc commend leadership personnel armi navi air forc sai put enemi pakistan place nativeclick ad take aim indian prime minist narendra modi pm shehbaz say world know train mukti bahini todai nexu see support group like bla ttp lead back modi rebuf recent statement make indian prime minist sai mr modi keep fieri speech pakistan seek peac region mistak desir stabil weak refer suspens indu water treati warn india tamper sai india even think stop pakistan’ water let know water blood flow togeth warn red line compromis note arm forc crush fals sens region domin harbour india illus india region power shatter ad prime minist assur pakistan commit dialogu unresolv issu includ kashmir disput howev say will allow onesid approach sweet thing welcom bitter truth ignor also warn modi futur hostil india meet forc unpreced respons modi attempt anoth act aggress will face consequ beyond imagin ad interact offic brave man frontlin premier laud high moral except profession unflinch readi pakistan take immens pride brave son crown jewel nation say ad blatant aggress innoc civilian result martyrdom child woman elderli call terrorist utterli shame intern law norm moral state despit pakistan’ offer neutral investig india deliber evad path noth prove base fals pretext bloat arrog ego launch offens get befit respons premier also say martyr alwai pride nation shall etern remain indebt oper bunyanummarsoo pakistan arm forc launch largescal retaliatori militari action name oper bunyanummarsoo target sever indian militari strike across multipl region strike describ offici precis proportion carri respons india continu aggress across line control loc within pakistan territori new delhi claim aim terrorist target less hour war two nucleararm nation end mai ceasefir agreement broke unit state accord ispr total individu includ personnel arm forc civilian martyr indian strike recent militari confront militari confront two countri trigger last month’ attack indian illeg occupi jammu kashmir iiojk leave tourist dead india blame pakistan attack without offer evid islamabad deni link attack call neutral investig say target hit wednesdai civilian site"

Speaking with Geo News on Wednesday, Asif said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was politically cornered and could take impulsive action due to mounting pressure and declining political capital. “If Modi makes a reckless move out of desperation, Pakistan will respond decisively – and there will be global consequences,” Asif said. The defence minister stated that in the event of further escalation, even India’s allies may refrain from backing Modi’s actions. “There was no external pressure on Pakistan to agree to a ceasefire,” he added. “The United States and other friendly countries were on board and supported the idea, which is why we agreed.” Asif said Pakistan exercised restraint for four days, hoping India would show reason. “Our victory is multidimensional. This was the first conflict in which cyber warfare played a key role. India’s digital infrastructure was paralysed during the cyber operations,” he said. He further stated that international perceptions of Pakistan have changed. “Those who did not take us seriously now look at us with respect,” he maintained, saying Pakistan downed five Indian aircraft and one UAV during the recent conflict with India. On Kashmir issue, the defence minister remarked that India had shown some willingness to engage. “For the first time, India seems ready to discuss the Kashmir issue – that in itself is a diplomatic success for Pakistan,” he said. NativeClick Ads Asif’s statement comes after a full and immediate ceasefire between India and Pakistan was announced on May 10, following days of heightened military exchanges that brought the two nuclear-armed neighbours to the brink of war. The announcement was first made by US President Donald Trump and later confirmed by Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. India-Pakistan ceasefire Tensions flared following an April 22 attack in Pahalgam, Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), which left 26 civilians dead. India blamed Pakistan-based elements without presenting any evidence, Islamabad rejected the allegations. In response, India closed the Wagah border, revoked visas, and suspended the Indus Waters Treaty—moves Pakistan called an “act of war.” The conflict intensified with India's missile attracks and drone incursions as it launched its Operation Sindoor. Pakistan's military launched Operation Bunyan-un-Marsoos in retaliation, and announced it had downed five Indian jets—including Rafales—and intercepted 77 Israeli-made Harop drones. Following diplomatic intervention led by Washington, both sides agreed to halt military activity across land, air, and sea. However, hours after the truce, fresh skirmishes were reported along both sides of the Line of Control.","india mai attempt anoth misadventur khawaja asif","defenc minist khawaja asif warn anoth possibl indian misadventur sai pakistan respond forcefulli provok speak geo new wednesdai asif say indian prime minist narendra modi polit corner take impuls action due mount pressur declin polit capit modi make reckless move desper pakistan will respond decis will global consequ asif say defenc minist state event escal even india’ alli mai refrain back modi’ action extern pressur pakistan agre ceasefir ad unit state friendli countri board support idea agre asif say pakistan exercis restraint four dai hope india show reason victori multidimension first conflict cyber warfar plai kei role india’ digit infrastructur paralys cyber oper say state intern percept pakistan chang take u serious now look u respect maintain sai pakistan down five indian aircraft on uav recent conflict india kashmir issu defenc minist remark india show will engag first time india seem readi discuss kashmir issu diplomat success pakistan say nativeclick ad asif’ statement come full immedi ceasefir india pakistan announc mai follow dai heighten militari exchang bring two nucleararm neighbour brink war announc first make u presid donald trump late confirm pakistan’ prime minist shehbaz sharif deputi prime minist ishaq dar indian extern affair minist  jaishankar u secretari state marco rubio indiapakistan ceasefir tension flare follow april attack pahalgam indian illeg occupi jammu kashmir iiojk leave civilian dead india blame pakistanbas element without present evid islamabad reject alleg respons india close wagah border revok visa suspend indu water treati move pakistan call act war conflict intensifi india missil attrack drone incur launch oper sindoor pakistan militari launch oper bunyanunmarsoo retali announc down five indian jet includ rafal intercept israelimad harop drone follow diplomat intervent lead washington side agre halt militari activ across land air sea howev hour truce fresh skirmish report along side line control"

"science-technology","https://www.risingbd.com/english/science-technology/news/112377","Prospect of expanding Afghanistan-Bangladesh trade","15/05/2025","The interest of the small business groups in Bangladesh to increase engagement with Afghanistan has increased recently. Though Afghanistan has not been in the radar of leading businessmen and exporters, small business leaders see the prospect of 100 million US dollars with the South Asian country in the next couple of years. According to available sources, the trade between Bangladesh-Afghanistan is hovering at some 30 million US dollars. Bangladesh’s export to Afghanistan recorded at $8.8 million (8858124.13 US dollars during the July-March period of 2024-25, according to data of the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) Bangladesh ’s export to Afghanistan recorded at (10 million US dollars) 10164582.64 US dollars during the July-June period of 2023-24 fiscal year, according to data of the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB). Some 42 per cent of Afghanistan’s total exports go to Pakistan, 40 per cent to India, 4.00 per cent to China, 2.00 per cent to UAE and 2.00 per cent to Turkey, according to Afghanistan data of Afghanistan. Afghanistan, the landlocked country in South Asia, can offer the best quality of fruits to Bangladesh at the most competitive prices compared to countries like South Africa, Brazil, China, Australia, India, Pakistan and Egypt, sources said. Apples come from South Africa, Brazil, China, and Australia, pomegranates from India, pears from Pakistan, sweet oranges from Egypt, tangerines from China and India, and grapes from India, industry people say. Bangladesh roughly spent $450 million in 2021-22 fiscal year to procure fruits from the countries like India, Pakistan, Egypt, South Africa, Brazil, China and Australia, industry people say. NativeClick Ads Traders opened LCs worth $247.26 million in July-January of 2023-24 fiscal year, up 25.81 percent year-on-year, central bank data showed. The purchase from external sources was $196.54 million in the identical seven months of the previous financial year and $326.33 million in 2021-22. About 40 percent of the country's demand for fruits is met locally, while the rest comes from imports. Afghanistan exports dry food to Bangladesh through Karachi and Chittagong ports as the South Asian county is a land locked one. Afghanistan has the population of over 40 million and Bangladesh can penetrate in the Afghan clothing market, said a member of the Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA)). Sources said China has the largest penetration of clothing market in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, Afghanistan’s economy is projected to grow by 2.6 percent in 2025, according to the International Monetary Fund’s latest World Economic Outlook released this week. This forecast places Afghanistan near the bottom of regional growth expectations, reflecting both internal economic constraints and the broader global slowdown. The IMF’s global growth projection for 2025 stands at 2.8 percent, the lowest since 2020 and the second-weakest figure since the 2009 financial crisis. The report attributes this deceleration to heightened trade tensions, rising tariffs, and policy uncertainty, particularly involving major economies such as the United States and China. Within Central Asia, Afghanistan’s projected growth rate lags behind several neighboring countries. For instance, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are expected to grow by 6.8 percent and 6.7 percent, respectively, while Uzbekistan is forecasted at 5.9 percent. Even Turkmenistan, with a projected growth of 2.3 percent, is only slightly behind Afghanistan. The IMF anticipates a modest improvement in Afghanistan’s economic performance in 2026, projecting a growth rate of 3.4 percent. However, this remains below the regional average and underscores the challenges facing the country’s economy. Afghanistan’s economic outlook is constrained by several factors, including limited access to international financial systems, reduced foreign aid, and restrictions on women’s participation in the workforce. These issues are compounded by internal challenges such as high unemployment, food insecurity, and a fragile banking sector. The IMF’s report emphasizes the need for structural reforms to enhance economic resilience. Recommendations include improving domestic revenue mobilization, fostering private sector development, and ensuring inclusive policies that enable broader participation in the economy. According to Al Jazeera in 2021, the U.S. freeze nearly $9.5 billion in assets belonging to the Afghan central bank and stopped shipments of cash to the nation as it tries to keep a Taliban-led government from accessing the money, an administration official confirmed recently. The official said that any central bank assets that the Afghan government has in the U.S. will not be available to the Taliban, which remains on the Treasury Department’s sanctions designation list. Taliban officials denounced claims that the United States could regain custody of Afghanistan's frozen central bank funds, warning that any such action would be ""unacceptable."" The Taliban-led Ministry of Economy issued the warning in response to the latest quarterly report released to the U.S. Congress on Friday stating that the government in Kabul is not recognized by Washington and has been subjected to economic sanctions. In August 2021, when Taliban insurgents retook control of the country just days before the withdrawal of all American and NATO troops, then-President Joe Biden froze about $7 billion in assets that were held in the U.S. by the Afghan central bank. Additionally, European countries froze around $2 billion. Washington subsequently transferred half of the frozen funds, amounting to $3.5 billion, to a newly established ""Afghan Fund"" in Switzerland. That fund is intended to support humanitarian assistance in impoverished Afghanistan while ensuring that the Taliban cannot access the money, but no payments have since been released. The remaining $3.5 billion was retained in the U.S. to fund potential compensation for ongoing court cases against the Taliban, brought by families of the September 11, 2001, attack victims. In August 2021, the United States withdrew the last of its troops from Afghanistan, ending its military presence there after nearly 20 years. Inflation in Afghanistan turned negative because of currency appreciation and subdued demand. In FY2024, annual inflation dropped from 10.6% to –7.7%, with food prices declining by 11.8% and prices for other items falling by 3.0% (Figure 2.14.2). Deflation resulted as the Afghani strengthened, reducing import prices demand was subdued and supply chains suffered fewer disruptions. The appreciation of the Afghani against key currencies, including the Pakistan rupee, Iranian riyal, and US dollar, contributed to lower domestic prices, as imports play a dominant role in the economy (Figure 2.14.3). Monetary policy continued to have little effect on prices. The merchandise trade deficit widened to 36.6% of GDP, reflecting currency appreciation and lower demand for minerals (Figure 2.14.4). In FY2024, exports dropped by 3.5% to $1.8 billion, mainly from reduced demand for Afghan coal in Pakistan and stagnant agricultural exports affected by currency appreciation. Merchandise imports increased by 13.5% to $8.0 billion. This reflected a 112.5% rise in intermediate goods and a 36.8% rise in consumer goods, fueled by private consumption, with Pakistan and Iran remaining Afghanistan’s largest import suppliers. The overall trade deficit in goods and services remained substantial at 42.4% of GDP, with imports rising by 12.1% and exports remaining stable Meanwhile, Afghanistan has one of the world’s lowest electricity consumption rates per capita. The country can generate only 20% of its electricity domestically, and barely one-third of its 36 million citizens are connected to the power grid. The remainder of its electricity is imported from Uzbekistan (40.5%), Tajikistan (24.0%), Turkmenistan (20.5%), and Iran (15.0%). The Afghanistan Power Sector Master Plan 2011 forecast electricity demand to rise from 2,800 gigawatt-hours in 2012 to 15,909 in 2032, with an annual growth rate of 9.8%. Peak demand was expected to grow by 8.6% annually, from 600 megawatts (MW) in 2012 to 3,502 MW in 2032. Actual demand in FY2024 was 1,500 MW, largely on track with the forecast. South Asia is one of the least integrated regions in the world in terms of trade and people-to-people contact. At present, regional trade in South Asia accounts for only 5% of estimated $23 billion in trade flow well below the potential trade of $67 billion. While the ratio of trade in other regions are East Asia: 50%, ASEAN: 26%, EU: 67%, NAFTA: 62%, LAC and COMESA 22%. Referring to the World Bank estimates, ICC Bangladesh reports Intra-regional trade now stands at just one-fifth of trade potential among South Asian countries. Meanwhile, India and Afghanistan held the highest-level talks since the Afghan group’s takeover of Kabul in 2021 in Dubai in January, 2025. The Taliban's foreign office said they saw India as a ""significant regional and economic partner"" after meeting with its most senior foreign ministry official, the highest level talks with Delhi since their takeover of Afghanistan in 2021. Against this backdrop, Bangladesh should explore and increase economic engagement with Afghanistan as the economy of the South Asian county is expanding slowly. In South Asia, Afghanistan's national currency, the afghani, is one of the strongest currencies against the US dollar. Currently, one U.S. dollar is traded at 72.30 afghani, compared to 69 afghanio.","prospect expand afghanistanbangladesh trade","interest small busi group bangladesh increas engag afghanistan increas

Under the new rules, couples will no longer need to register marriages in the location of their hukou, which is permanent household registration. Instead, they will be able to choose a registry office in the habitual residence of either party, removing a significant logistical barrier. This reform is aimed at addressing the needs of people who live or work away from their registered hometowns, particularly younger generations. Previously, couples had to return to their hukou location for marriage registration, which created travel and financial difficulties. According to the latest national census, about 493 million Chinese people lived away from their hukou location in 2020, an 88.52 percent increase from a decade earlier. A pilot program for inter-provincial marriage registration began in June 2021 and was gradually expanded to 21 provincial-level regions, including Beijing, Shanghai and Inner Mongolia. By February 2025, approximately 492,000 couples had benefited from the program. The reform was made possible through the digitalization of the marriage registration system. A national marriage information database has been established, enabling civil affairs agencies nationwide to share data seamlessly. To streamline the process further, the Ministry of Civil Affairs plans to improve digital infrastructure for online appointments and inter-provincial data verification, ensuring a smoother experience for couples across the country._Agencies.","china lift hukoubas marriag registr restrict nationwid","china will soon offer nationwid access crossregion marriag registr servic follow recent revis regul governmentern marriag registr ministri civil affair say saturdai report people’ daili new rule coupl will long need regist marriag locat hukou perman household registr instead will abl choos registri offic habitu resid either parti remov signific logist barrier reform aim address need peopl live work awai regist hometown particularli young gener previous coupl return hukou locat marriag registr creat travel financi difficulti accord late nation censu million chine peopl live awai hukou locat percent increas decad early pilot program interprovinci marriag registr begin june gradual expand provinciallevel region includ beij shanghai inner mongolia februari approxim coupl benefit program reform make possibl digit marriag registr system nation marriag inform databas establish enabl civil affair agenc nationwid share datum seamlessli streamlin process ministri civil affair plan improv digit infrastructur onlin appoint interprovinci datum verif ensur smooth experi coupl across countryag"

Noting that the whole world has understood that we as a nation do not carry the identity of honesty, Yunus said this is not only a matter of national disgrace, but it is a suicidal issue in international trade. “Like the countrymen, the international community also wants us to be free from corruption, because they want to expand trade and commerce with us.

This move, the most significant tariff cut in years, is aimed at preventing retaliatory US tariffs. With US President Donald Trump’s new reciprocal tariffs set to take effect on April 2, global markets have been rattled, and policymakers, including those in Western nations—are rushing to respond. The South Asian nation wants to mitigate the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump’s reciprocal worldwide tariffs set to take effect from April 2, a threat that has disrupted markets and sent policymakers scrambling, even among Western allies. According to an internal analysis by India, the new US tariffs could affect 87% of Indian exports to the US, valued at approximately $66 billion, two government officials said. To avoid this impact, India is open to lowering tariffs on 55% of US imports that are currently taxed between 5% and 30%, according to sources. Some of these tariffs may be reduced significantly, while others could be entirely removed. A US delegation, led by Brendan Lynch, Assistant US Trade Representative for South and Central Asia, is set to visit India for trade talks beginning Tuesday. The Indian government hopes to finalize a deal before the US reciprocal tariffs take effect. During Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the US in February, both nations agreed to begin early trade talks to resolve tariff disputes.

"politics","https://www.risingbd.com/english/politics/news/111266","Great Independence Day today","26/03/2025","The nation is celebrating its 55th Independence and National Day today with due respect and elaborate programmes. On the night of 25 March 1971, the Pakistani military launched Operation Searchlight, a brutal crackdown aimed at suppressing calls for autonomy, resulting in mass killings and widespread displacement. In response, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman declared independence, but he was arrested shortly after. On 26 March, Major Ziaur Rahman announced the declaration of independence over the radio, marking the official beginning of the Bangladesh Liberation War. The nine-month-long war claimed the lives of three million people and violated the dignity of two lakh women. However, the nation’s courage and sacrifice led to victory, and on 16 December 1971, Bangladesh achieved its long-awaited independence. Today, the country honours those supreme sacrifices made during the war and continues its journey of rebuilding and reforming following the July uprising. President Mohammed Shahabuddin and Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus have issued separate messages on the occasion, extending heartfelt greetings and warm felicitations to the countrymen living both home and abroad. The government has taken elaborate programmes marking the Independence and National Day. The day’s programmes began by heralding gun salutes early in the morning as a mark of profound respect to the heroic struggle of this nation, which suffered a protracted subjugation under foreign rules from time to time till achieving their coveted Independence in 1971. NativeClick Ads The national flag has been hoisted atop all government, semi-government, autonomous and private buildings with the rises of sun while all streets and important city intersections have been decorated with national and multi-coloured miniature flags and festoons.

The National Martyrs’ Memorial at Savar is the main venue of the celebration of the day. President Mohammed Shahabuddin and Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus have placed wreaths early in the morning as a mark of profound respect to the memories of the martyrs. The day is marked as a public holiday, with numerous events and activities organised by the interim government at the national level. It began with a 31-gun salute across the country, including Dhaka, as announced by the Ministry of Liberation War Affairs. Both the president and chief adviser laid wreaths in the morning to honour the martyrs of 1971. Families of the Birsreshtha, war-wounded freedom fighters, and other brave freedom fighters, led by the Liberation War Affairs adviser, also paid their respects.

The wildfires began late on Friday in Sancheong county in Northern Gyeongsang province before spreading to neighbouring Uiseong county – located about 180km (111 miles) southeast of the capital Seoul – and have advanced into Andong, Cheongsong, Yeongyang, and Yeongdeok counties. The Korea Forest Service said firefighters were fighting at least five active wildfires nationwide as of Wednesday morning. The death toll jumped to 24 on Wednesday as wind-driven flames tore through neighbourhoods and razed an ancient temple, officials said. Among those killed was a pilot of a firefighting helicopter who died when his aircraft crashed in a mountain area in Uiseong. Officials in Andong and other southeastern cities and towns have ordered residents to evacuate as firefighters struggle to contain the fires, which have burned more than 17,000 hectares (42,000 acres) of forest and destroyed hundreds of structures, including the more than 1,000-year-old Gounsa temple in Uiseong.

"politics","https://www.risingbd.com/english/politics/news/111276","Escalating threat of AI-powered cyber attacks and strategies for","26/03/2025","Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the digital world, offering advancements that were once the realm of science fiction. However, it’s also becoming a double-edged sword. While AI helps enhance cyber security defenses, it’s also being used as a weapon by cybercriminals to conduct more sophisticated and effective attacks. AI-powered cyber threats can easily bypass traditional security measures, making them more dangerous than ever. This article demonstrates how AI is being used in cyber attacks and the best strategies to defend against them. How AI is Used in Cyber Attacks 1. AI-Enhanced Phishing Attacks: Phishing has always been a major cyber threat, but in today’s world, AI has made it more dangerous. Traditional phishing emails often contain grammatical errors or generic messaging, making them easier to detect. However, AI-powered phishing campaigns use machine learning to observe a target’s social media, emails, and online activities to craft highly personalized emails. These AI-generated emails are indistinguishable from legitimate communications. Incident: According to news.com.au, in 2023, cyber criminals exploited artificial intelligence to conduct sophisticated phishing attacks, notably targeting the travel industry. They used AI to create convincing fake booking emails that mimicked legitimate communications from reputable companies like Booking.com. This led to a significant increase in travel-related scams, with Australians losing over $337,000 in that year alone. 2. AI-Driven Malware and Ransomware: AI enables malware to adapt and evolve, making detection and mitigation more challenging. This intelligent malware can learn from the environment, modify it’s behavior to avoid detection, and even identify high-value targets within a network. Incident: According to The Hacker News, in January 2025, the AI-driven ransomware FunkSec attacked over 85 organizations worldwide, using AI to automate attacks and optimize ransom demands. They used double extortion tactics, encrypting data while threatening to leak sensitive information if the ransom wasn’t paid. 3. Deepfake Impersonations: The emergence of deepfake technology has introduced a new way for cyber attacks. By creating realistic audio and video impersonations, attackers can deceive individuals into exposing sensitive information or authorizing fraudulent transactions. NativeClick Ads Incident: According to India Today, in November 2023, scammers used deepfake technology to impersonate a retired police officer, blackmailing a 74-year-old man into paying $1,000 by threatening him with fake charges. 4. AI-Powered Botnets and DDoS Attacks: AI has enhanced the capabilities of botnets—networks of compromised computers used to launch large-scale Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. These botnets can adapt their strategies in real time, making mitigation more complex. Incident: According to the World Economic Forum, in May 2024, the FBI dismantled a global botnet that had infected millions of computers across nearly 200 countries. This botnet facilitated numerous cybercrimes, including financial scams, identity theft, bomb threats, and access to child exploitation materials. Government and Policymaker Responses As cyber threats continue to evolve, governments and policymakers around the world have been ramping up their efforts to mitigate the growing risks posed by AI-powered cyber attacks. 1. Regulatory Frameworks and Policies: Governments are developing regulations to ensure the responsible use of AI and to protect against its malicious applications. European Union (EU): The EU is advancing the Artificial Intelligence Act, aiming to establish comprehensive guidelines for AI development and deployment, including stringent requirements for high-risk AI systems. United States: The Cyber Security and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has outlined efforts to integrate AI considerations into federal cyber security strategies, emphasizing the need for trustworthy AI in government operations. 2. International Collaboration: Cyber threats are borderless, prompting international cooperation to combat AI-driven cybercrime. Agencies like Europol are collaborating with global partners to share intelligence, coordinate responses, and develop unified strategies against these evolving threats. 3. Investment in AI Research and Development: Governments are investing in AI research to stay ahead of cybercriminals. This includes funding for developing AI tools capable of detecting and countering AI-driven attacks, as well as fostering public-private partnerships to leverage industry expertise. Defensive Strategies for Organizations Organizations must adopt proactive measures to defend against AI-powered cyber threats. 1. Implementation of AI-Based Security Solutions: Leveraging AI for defense involves deploying systems that can detect anomalies, predict potential threats, and respond in real-time. These AI-driven security solutions can analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns indicative of cyber threats. 2. Adoption of a Zero Trust Security Model: The Zero Trust model operates on the principle that no entity, internal or external, should be automatically trusted. Continuous verification and strict access controls are enforced to minimize potential attacks. 3. Continuous Employee Training: Human error remains a significant vulnerability. Regular training programs can educate employees about the latest phishing techniques, the dangers of deepfakes, and best practices for maintaining cyber security hygiene. Protective Measures for the General Public Individuals also play a crucial role in the cyber security ecosystem. By adopting certain practices, the general public can mitigate the risks posed by AI-driven cyber threats. 1. Vigilance Against Phishing Attempts: Being cautious of unsolicited communications and verifying the authenticity of requests can prevent falling victim to phishing scams. 2. Utilization of Strong, Unique Passwords: Employing complex passwords and changing them regularly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.

The Indian government, run by Hindu nationalist BJP party, has been engaging in and tolerating systematic, ongoing, and egregious religious freedom violations, says the USCIRF report released late Tuesday. In the run up to the general elections in June 2024, the ruling party used hateful rhetoric as well as disinformation against Muslims and other minorities to gather votes from the Hindu majority. The malpractice fueled vigilante and arbitrary communal attacks both before and after the elections. Upon election, the BJP-run government exploited laws to also target human rights activists, civil society members and journalists, many a times for speaking on behalf of the religious minorities. Numerous building authorities, including the Delhi Development Authority, took steps for the demolition and seizure of minority assets. The Ram Temple was built a razed mosque, and consecration of the temple was followed by a series of minority attacks, the report notes. BJP-run federal government and its provincial allies also arbitrarily passed anti-conversion laws. RAW agents engaged in targeted attacks on religious minorities, particularly Sikhs, in foreign lands. One US citizen was assassinated in New York in 2023, allegedly during a RAW operation.","u govern agenc recommend blacklist india","u commiss intern religi freedom uscirf urg white hous design india countri particular concern impos target sanction raw india’ extern spy servic gross violat religi minor right indian governmentern run hindu nationalist bjp parti engag toler systemat ongo egregi religi freedom violat sai uscirf report releas late tuesdai run gener elect june rule parti us hate rhetor good disinform muslim minor gather vote hindu major malpractic fuel vigilant arbitrari commun attack elect upon elect bjprun governmentern exploit law also target human right activist civil societi member journalist mani time speak behalf religi minor numer build author includ delhi develop author take step demolit seizur minor asset ram templ build raze mosqu consecr templ follow seri minor attack report note bjprun feder governmentern provinci alli also arbitrarili pass anticonvers law raw agent engag target attack religi minor particularli sikh foreign land on u citizen assassin new york allegedli raw oper"

"politics","https://www.risingbd.com/english/politics/news/111290","Trump announces 25% tariffs on foreign-built vehicles","27/03/2025","US President Donald Trump has announced new import taxes of 25% on cars and car parts coming into the US in a move that threatens to widen the global trade war, the BBC reported. Trump said the latest tariffs would come into effect on 2 April, with charges on businesses importing vehicles starting the next day. Charges on parts are set to start in May or later. The president claimed the measure would lead to ""tremendous growth"" for the car industry, promising it would spur jobs and investment in the US. But analysts have said the move is likely to lead to the temporary shutdown of significant car production in the US, increase prices, and strain relations with allies. The US imported roughly eight million cars last year, accounting for about $240bn (£186bn) in trade and roughly half of overall sales. Mexico is the top foreign supplier of cars to the US, followed by South Korea, Japan, Canada and Germany. Trump's latest move threatens to upend global car trade and supply chains. Many US car companies have operations in Mexico and Canada as well, set up under the terms of the longstanding free trade agreement between the three countries. The White House said the order would apply not only to finished cars but also to car parts, which are often shipped in from other countries before getting assembled in the US. NativeClick Ads However, the new tariffs on parts from Canada and Mexico are exempt while US customs and border patrol set up a system to assess the duties, the White House said. The neighbouring countries see goods worth billions cross borders each day. On Wednesday, shares in General Motors slid roughly 3%. The sell-off spread to other companies, including Ford, after the president's remarks as he confirmed the tariffs. Asked at a press conference if there was any chance he would reverse course, Trump said no, adding later: ""This is permanent."" ""If you build your car in the United States there is no tariff,"" he said. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said his government would put ""all options on the table"" in response to the tariffs. Japan, which is home to several major motor industry giants, is the world's second largest exporter of cars. Shares in Japanese carmakers - including Toyota, Nissan, Honda - fell in early trade in Tokyo. A tariff is a tax on imports collected by a government and it is paid by the company importing the good.","trump announc tariff foreignbuilt vehicl","u presid donald trump announc new import tax car car part come u move threaten widen global trade war bbc report trump say late tariff come effect april charg busi import vehicl start next dai charg part set start mai late presid claim measur lead tremend growth car industri promis spur job invest u analyst say move like lead temporari shutdown signific car product u increas price strain relat alli u import roughli eight million car last year account bn bn trade roughli half overal sale mexico top foreign supplier car u follow south korea japan canada germani trump late move threaten upend global car trade suppli chain mani u car compani oper mexico canada good set term longstand free trade agreement three countri white hous say order appli finish car also car part often ship countri get assembl u nativeclick ad howev new tariff part canada mexico exempt u custom border patrol set system assess duti white hous say neighbour countri see good worth billion cross border dai wednesdai share gener motor slide roughli selloff spread compani includ ford presid remark confirm tariff ask press confer chanc revers cours trump say ad late perman build car unit state tariff say japanes prime minist shigeru ishiba say governmentern put option tabl respons tariff japan home sever major motor industri giant world 2 large export car share japanes carmak includ toyota nissan honda fall earli trade tokyo tariff tax import collect governmentern pay compani import good"

Khoudary said the attack was one of several carried out by the Israeli military across the Strip over recent hours, including a strike on a home in the as-Saftawi area of Gaza City, which killed six members of the same family. On March 18, Israel abruptly ended a fragile two-month ceasefire as it resumed its intense bombing campaign and ground operations in Gaza. Israel has since killed hundreds of Palestinian civilians in an attempt to pressure Hamas into freeing the remaining captives held in the war-torn enclave. Several senior Hamas officials have also been killed over the past week. On Sunday, an Israeli air strike on the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis in southern Gaza killed five people, including Ismail Barhoum, the head of finances and institutions within Hamas’s political office.","israel kill hama spokesperson abdellatif","hama spokesperson kill isra air strike northern gaza new outlet confirm israel’ armi continu renew assault besieg enclav hama spokesperson abdellatif awami leagueqanoua kill isra fighter jet bomb tent shelter northern citi jabalia earli hour thursdai morn accord alaqsa televis shehab new agenc sever peopl wind strike includ child accord hind khoudari al jazeera correspond gaza khoudari say attack on sever carri isra militari across strip recent hour includ strike home assaftawi area gaza citi kill six member famili march israel abruptli end fragil twomonth ceasefir resum intens bomb campaign grind oper gaza israel sinc kill hundr palestinian civilian attempt pressur hama free remain captiv hold wartorn enclav sever senior hama offici also kill past week sundai isra air strike nasser hospit khan youni southern gaza kill five peopl includ ismail barhoum head financ institut within hamas’ polit offic"

We must chart a clear roadmap for a shared future and shared prosperity,” he said while addressing Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) conference in Hainan on Thursday (March 27) morning. About financial cooperation, the Chief Adviser said, “Asia must create a sustainable financing mechanism. We need reliable funds that address our challenges and meet our growing demands.” Regarding trade cooperation, he said Asia remains one of the least integrated regions. This weak integration stifles investment and trade. We must work to boost trade cooperation immediately, he noted. About food and agriculture cooperation, Prof Yunus said the Asian countries must promote resource-efficient farming and domestic production must be enhanced for food security. “We need to reduce import reliance and achieve self-sufficiency. Expanding tech-based sustainable agricultural solutions and innovation in regenerative and climate-smart farming is key,” he said. The Chief Adviser said Asia must build a strong tech ecosystem, which should be restorative, distributive and inclusive. “We need to share knowledge and data, and invest in technology incubation and innovation.

He didn’t specify the quantum of payments and whether past arrears have been cleared. Data from BPDB shows Adani increased power supply more than two weeks ago. Adani Power Ltd. had halved supply from its 1,600 megawatt coal-fired plant in India’s Jharkhand state in November after a series of missed payments by Dhaka, which was battling a foreign exchange crisis amid a turbulent change of regime. Restoration of supply will help Bangladesh avoid blackouts in the sweltering summer months when temperatures can reach 38C (100.4F) or more. Shares of the company extended gains after the report, climbing as much as 2% in Mumbai. The stock has declined nearly 5% so far this year. The dues, which had at one point crossed $850 million, now stands at $800 million and the same would be cleared in next six months, people familiar with the matter said. The BPDB had also provided guarantees to reassure Adani’s lenders to ease the company’s working capital crunch, they said, requesting not to be named as the information is private. A representative of the Adani Group did not immediately respond to a request for comments. The restoration of power is a step to help repair business ties between the two nations.

The Red Sea Governorate said the submarine, named ""Sindbad"", had 50 people onboard: 45 tourists of different nationalities from Russia, India, Norway, and Sweden, and five Egyptian crew members. ""Most of those on board were rescued and taken to their hotels and hospitals in Hurghada,"" the Russian consulate in Hurghada said. The submarine was equipped with large portholes to let passengers see the Red Sea's spectacular corals and marine life, and was able to descend to a depth of 25 metres, according to the company's website. The pleasure craft was a far cry from the extreme adventure submersible that imploded thousands of metres below the Atlantic near the sunken Titanic in June 2023. The Red Sea is a major hub for Egypt's crucial tourism industry, a pillar of the economy, in which Russian tourists play an increasing part. Egypt also attracts tourists with its great pyramids of Giza and cruises on the Nile in Luxor and Aswan. Successive Egyptian governments have waged successful crackdowns on Islamist militant groups who hurt the tourism industry with attacks on foreigners in the past. Egyptian authorities are conducting investigations with crew members to determine the causes of the submarine sinking, the local governorate cited Red Sea Province Governor Amr Hanafy as saying.

Despite resting key forwards Robert Lewandowski and Raphinha, the Catalan club raced into a two-goal lead through a Ferran Torres tap-in and a Dani Olmo penalty – after a retake. Second-half substitute Lewandowski headed home the third in the 77th minute to wrap up a sixth-straight win for Barca. In truth, it could and should have been a lot more for the home side, whose unbeaten run in all competitions has extended to 19 games. “Every match is a final from now on and today wasn’t different. We solved it quickly and soundly and that’s the important thing. Three points and move on,” first-goal scorer Torres told reporters. Torres opened the scoring for the home side in the 11th minute with a first-time finish from inside the six-yard box as he met with Alejandro Balde’s cross in a terrific team goal. Olmo extended the lead 10 minutes later from the penalty spot after he was fouled while attempting to round the Osasuna keeper. It took two efforts to find the goal for Olmo, whose first kick was saved but had to be retaken after an Osasuna player was found to have encroached in the area.

"politics","https://www.risingbd.com/english/politics/news/111323","Climate change poses severe threats to Bangladesh, urgent action needed","28/03/2025","Bangladesh is rich in natural resources. The fertility of the soil and the temperate climate allow for abundant crop production. Due to industrialization, the country has not faced significant difficulties. Our labor is cheap, which has made us known for our productivity. However, without any fault of our own, we are facing consequences due to climate change. The industrialized nations are responsible for carbon emissions. Bangladesh is not significantly responsible for global climate change, yet we are the ones suffering the most. Although the climate has been changing since the beginning, the effects have just become apparent in recent decades. It is impacting Bangladesh with increased extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and food insecurity, necessitating adaptation strategies like building seawalls, diversifying crops, and investing in early warning systems. Bangladesh ranks at the top of the list of countries affected by climate change. According to the Global Climate Risk Index published by the international research organization Germanwatch in 2010, Bangladesh is the most impacted country in terms of damage caused by climate change among the top ten-affected nations. The survey was conducted on 193 countries from 1990 to 2009. It is worth noting that in the reports published by the same organization in 2007 and 2008, Bangladesh was also identified as the most affected country. Scientists say that if global warming continues at the same rate, a large area of Bangladesh will be flooded in the next 100 years, and about 30 million people will become refugees. Due to the country's geographical location, population density, and economic structure, Bangladesh will be severely impacted by the negative effects of climate change. Numerous statistics clearly indicate that significant changes are occurring and will occur in the country's ecosystems and the livelihoods of its people as a result of climate change. Experts say climate change has become a global crisis. The changing climate is increasingly posing a significant challenge to the existence of human civilization. It is an issue that does not respect the boundaries of countries, nations, subcontinents, or continents. The impacts of climate change are already being felt, and urgent action is needed to reduce vulnerability and build resilience. Climate Change and its Impact in Bangladesh According to environmental scientists, Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by global warming. The major natural disasters that have been occurring in Bangladesh in recent times are mainly due to climate change. Following are the top effects in Bangladesh. They are Changed Natural seasonal characteristics, decreasing natural resources in Bangladesh, Sea Level Rise, Biodiversity Destruction, Flash floods, Drought, Decrease in River Flow and Increase in Salinity of Water, Ocean Storms and Tidal Surges, etc. Severe Impact on Agriculture Agriculture is the lifeblood of Bangladesh's economy. The economy and livelihoods of Bangladesh are built on four pillars, one of which is agriculture. Climate change is having a significant negative impact on agriculture. The agricultural sector is considered the most vulnerable industry. This is because its productivity entirely depends on factors such as temperature, rainfall, solar radiation, sunlight duration, and climate-related conditions. The average rainfall in Bangladesh has significantly increased compared to previous years. This average annual rainfall is expected to rise further by 2030. More than 80% of the land in Bangladesh is flood-prone. Floods caused by tidal surges cause extensive damage in coastal areas. Currently, around 1.5 million hectares of land in Bangladesh are affected by floods each year. In hilly regions, excessive rainfall erodes the fertile topsoil of elevated areas, gradually diminishing the soil's fertility and making it increasingly unsuitable for crop production. NativeClick Ads Another major barrier to crop production in Bangladesh is drought, which is becoming more pronounced due to climate change. Drought occurs when the rate of evaporation exceeds that of precipitation in a particular area. In Bangladesh, 60% of the 8.3 million hectares of arable land affected by different levels of drought is used for cultivating Aman rice. Additionally, crops such as Aus and Boro rice, jute, pulses, oilseeds, potatoes, sugarcane, and winter vegetables are severely impacted by drought conditions. The number of floods is gradually increasing, this is also an effect of climate change: Photo: Collected River erosion is increasing due to climate change. As a result, a lot of productive agricultural land is disappearing into the riverbed. According to a survey by the Bangladesh Water Development Board, 1,200 kilometers of riverbanks have been eroded so far and another 500 kilometers are at risk of erosion. Agriculture in Bangladesh is facing various threats such as irregular and insufficient rainfall, insufficient irrigation water due to low water tables, floods in coastal areas at various times besides the monsoon season, increased salinity due to rising sea levels, and land being submerged in water. Affecting human health Climate change is impacting health in a myriad of ways, including by leading to death and illness from increasingly frequent extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, storms and floods, the disruption of food systems, increases in zoonoses and food-, water- and vector-borne diseases, and mental health issues. In Bangladesh leading to increased risks of infectious diseases, heat-related illnesses, and mental health issues, exacerbated by extreme weather events and environmental degradation. What can we do While developed nations bear the primary responsibility for climate change, it is imperative that the global community collaborates to address this pressing issue. Our contribution should focus on implementing comprehensive afforestation initiatives. Trees play a crucial role in absorbing harmful carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen, thereby helping to maintain environmental balance. The initiation of afforestation programs should be prioritized in coastal and riverine regions of the country. This will mitigate riverbank erosion and lessen the severity of sea storms. Concurrently, it is essential to halt deforestation. In addition, efforts must be directed towards reducing the emissions of harmful gases that contribute to atmospheric warming. Industries should prioritize energy conservation and adopt measures to treat waste effectively. Bangladesh is prone to natural disasters, with various types occurring annually. As climate change intensifies, these disasters are expected to become more severe in the coming years. Therefore, it is crucial to raise awareness and prepare adequately for the challenges ahead. Experts Opinion Dr. Mohammad Tarikul Islam, Professor of Government and Politics at Jahangirnagar University, Bangladesh said that, The Government of Bangladesh has made a few significant moves in recent years to establish institutional frameworks for efficient and organized disaster management and easing the suffering of disaster and climate victims. But Bangladesh is a disaster-prone nation. We are now at great risk for various reasons. He stated like other countries of the Global South, climate change has elicited a rise in extreme weather phenomena such as floods, droughts, extreme temperatures, heavy rains, and storms. Climate change events are more frequent, and impact all facets of human existence. Dr. Mohammad Tarikul Islam said, beyond city innovations, there are opportunities to learn from and collaborate with neighboring countries. Through mutual cooperation, the nations of South Asia could help each other adapt to difficult situations, learn from one another, and even prosper. Having consistently supported the Global South in gatherings like COP, the G20, and the Voice of the Global South Summit, both India and Bangladesh have institutional expertise they may draw upon therefore, they should leverage resources to solve their common concerns and raise their voices on the international scene by putting up a single front. Dr Rejaul Karim, Associate professor of Varendra University said, at the global stage, Bangladesh is engaged in climate diplomacy, promoting the need for more ambitious objectives to limit the increase in global temperatures and to assist vulnerable countries, including itself. The Global Goal on Adaptation, a significant result of the Paris Agreement, seeks to bolster the resilience of nations like Bangladesh through both financial and technical assistance. Furthermore, he emphasized that tackling the climate crisis necessitates more than just local initiatives. Bangladesh has been a strong proponent of climate finance, calling on developed countries to honor their obligations to the Green Climate Fund and other international support frameworks. Global collaboration is essential, particularly as Bangladesh's adaptation strategies demand considerable investment.","climat chang pose sever threat bangladesh urgent action need","bangladesh rich

The meeting held at the Chinese capital’s Great Hall of the People discussed issues of mutual interest, with President Xi Jinping reiterating China’s full support for the Chief Adviser and the reform agenda of the Interim Government. Bestowing a rare honour to the Bangladesh leader, President Xi came out from his office to greet Prof Yunus as he arrived at the Great Hall, accompanied by two advisers. Later, the two leaders led their respective sides in a bilateral meeting, marked by warmth and candour. It was the first bilateral visit by the Chief Adviser to a foreign country. Describing Bangladesh as an important neighbour of China, President Xi Jinping offered to share Beijing’s development experiences and boost cooperation with Bangladesh to help it grow fast. The Chinese President said China would continue to grant zero-tariff facilities to Bangladeshi goods and extend the status until the end of 2028- two years after Bangladesh’s scheduled graduation from a least developed country. He said Beijing would like to start negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement and Investment Agreement with Dhaka to pave the way for more Chinese investment in the South Asian nation. President Xi said his government would encourage more Chinese private investment and relocation of Chinese manufacturing plants to Bangladesh after the Chief Adviser Prof Yunus sought his active support for this major shift in Chinese investment policy. NativeClick Ads The Chinese President said China would support building an exclusive Chinese industrial economic zone and industrial parks in Bangladesh. He welcomed more Bangladeshi products to China and “high-quality” cooperation in BRI projects, as well as the digital and maritime economy. The Chinese president welcomed more Bangladeshis to seek treatment in hospitals in Yunnan and other provinces of China. China has also announced it would build a specialised hospital in Bangladesh. The Chief Adviser said Bangladesh wants to elevate its relationship with China to a new height. He also sought Chinese support in resolving the Rohingya crisis. President Xi reiterated China’s support for the repatriation of the forcibly displaced people of Myanmar who have taken shelter in Bangladesh. Prof Yunus sought China’s support for young people’s dreams to create a new Bangladesh and invited Beijing to set up a China cultural centre in Bangladesh. He also sought a cut in interest rates for Chinese project loans and a waiver of the commitment fees charged on the borrowing. Xi recalled his two visits to Bangladesh and said he studied microcredit, pioneered by Prof Yunus, when he was the governor of Fujian province. He said China would give a positive consideration to the issues raised by the Chief Adviser. He said he tasted Bangladeshi mango and jackfruit and appreciated their quality, as China is poised to import the fruits from the country. The two leaders also discussed China’s support for the Teesta River project, the purchase of multiple-role combat aircraft and multimodal transport connectivity linking the southern Chinese city of Kunming with Bangladeshi ports. “Today, we witnessed history in the making. This is a transformational visit, and the two leaders have laid a solid foundation for intensified strategic ties, which will last through decades,” said Dr. Khalilur Rahman, High Representative of the Chief Adviser, who is on the Bangladesh delegation to China. Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, Chairman of China’s National Development and Reform Commission Zheng Shanjie, and vice foreign minister Sun Weidong were among senior Chinese officials who were present at the meeting.

The shallow 7.7-magnitude quake struck northwest of the city of Sagaing in central Myanmar on Friday causing massive destruction across large parts of the country. The powerful quake hit northwest of Myanmar’s Sagaing at 12:50 pm (0650 GMT) on Friday at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres (six miles). It was followed minutes later by a powerful 6.7-magnitude aftershock and a dozen smaller tremors. The quake was felt across the region, with shaking reported from India to the west and China to the east, as well as Cambodia and Laos. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) said at least 14 aftershocks hit Myanmar after a 7.7-magnitude earthquake. The death toll in Myanmar quake is expected to exceed 10,000, the USGS said. The quake hit along the Sagaing Fault that runs from the coast to Myanmar’s northern border, according to earthquake scientists Judith Hubbard and Kyle Bradley.

USGS’s predictive modelling estimated the death toll could exceed 10,000 people in Myanmar, and that losses could be greater than the value of the country’s gross domestic product. Susan Hough, a scientist in the USGS’s Earthquake Hazards Program, said it was difficult to predict an earthquake’s death toll, for various reasons including timing. When an earthquake strikes during the daytime, as it did in Myanmar, “people are awake, they have their wits about them, they are better able to respond,” she said. The USGS said at least 14 aftershocks hit Myanmar after a 7.7-magnitude earthquake. Meanwhile, international aid began to arrive in Myanmar on Saturday as rescuers searched for survivors after a powerful earthquake devastated the Southeast Asian nation amid concerns the number killed would soar. The death toll in Myanmar jumped to 694 with 1,670 injured, the military government said, up sharply from the 144 dead that state media reported on Friday. “Infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and buildings were affected, leading to casualties and injuries among civilians. Search and rescue operations are currently being carried out in the affected areas,” the junta said in a statement issued on state media.

This January, he was sentenced to 14 years in prison in a case related to the misuse of authority and corruption. In 2019, Khan was also nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to promote peace in South Asia. Every year, the Norwegian Nobel Committee receives hundreds of nominations, after which they select the winner through a lengthy eight-month process. Khan lost power after a no-confidence vote in April 2022. He denies all charges against him, calling them politically motivated.

The UN has described the attacks as “completely outrageous and unacceptable”. Special Rapporteur Tom Andrews told the BBC that it was “nothing short of incredible” that the military was continuing to “drop bombs when you are trying to rescue people” after the earthquake. He called on the military regime, which seized power in a coup nearly four years ago to stop all military operations. “Anyone who has influence on the military needs to step up the pressure and make it very clear that this is not acceptable,” he said. “I’m calling upon the junta to just stop, stop any of its military operations,” he added. BBC Burmese confirmed that seven people were killed in an air strike in Naungcho in northern Shan state. This strike took place around 15:30 local time, less than three hours after the quake struck. Pro-democracy rebel groups that are fighting to remove the military from power have reported aerial bombings in Chang-U township in the north-western Sagaing region, the epicentre of the quake. There are also reports of airstrikes in regions near the Thai border. NativeClick Ads The National Unity Government (NUG), which represents the ousted civilian administration, said in a statement that its armed forces would begin a two-week pause in “offensive military operations, except for defensive actions” in areas affected by the earthquake, from Sunday.

She made the announcement through a message on her Facebook account on Saturday (March 29). Explaining the reason behind rejecting the award, Umama mentioned, ""The collective recognition of women activists is highly honorable for us. However, this award has been used to directly endorse Israel's brutal attack on Palestine in October 2023. By refusing acknowledgement of the Palestinian war for independence, the award has justified Israel's assault in a way that questions its neutrality. While the Palestinian people continue to be deprived of their fundamental human rights, including land rights, I am personally rejecting this award as a mark of respect for the Palestinian struggle for freedom."" The US State Department stated that women played a pivotal role in Bangladesh’s student movement against the previous government's violent repression in July-August 2024. Despite threats and violence, they demonstrated extraordinary courage by standing alongside male protesters. When their male counterparts were arrested, these women devised new strategies to maintain communication and lead the movement.

On Wednesday, Trump announced new 25% tariffs on cars and car parts entering the US to begin on 2 April. Charges on businesses importing vehicles are expected on 3 April, and taxes on parts are set to start in May or later. When asked about what his message was to car bosses, he said: ""The message is congratulations. If you make your car in the United States, you're going to make a lot of money."" He continued: ""If you don't, you're going to have to probably come to the United States, because if you make your car in the United States, there is no tariff."" Recent polling by BBC's US partner CBS News suggests that consumers are worried the tariffs will raise prices, with 72% indicating that they believe costs will increase in the short-term.

"politics","https://www.risingbd.com/english/politics/news/111376","Loss and Damage, a growing concern for South Asia","31/03/2025","South Asian countries including Bangladesh face immense and irreversible losses because of climate change. But support from developed countries is lacking. Loss and damage, with progress being minimal amidst fluctuating interests. The wealthy world has created the climate crisis, while the poorer nations, which emit very little carbon, are suffering the most. Addressing climate change requires financing, yet as the UN climate summit COP29 approaches, there is still no sign of funding. Progress has been limited at the event held in Baku, Azerbaijan. Climate experts have called on countries to take swift, effective, and collective action. All negotiations at the climate conference seem to be stuck on the issue of financing. Despite much talk about money, the tangible outcomes are minimal. While affected nations strive to bring about change, they are met with resistance. As a result, environmental activists expressed their frustration throughout the day in Baku. Many placards during the protests echoed the term ‘greenwash’ which means misleading people by concealing the truth. Environmentalists lack confidence in the grand promises made by leaders from various countries to reduce global temperatures during discussions at the conference. Representatives from affected countries, including Bangladesh, have openly voiced in various forums and press conferences that developed nations are failing to fulfill their commitments. They argue that a handful of wealthy countries, having recklessly burned coal, oil, and gas for years, have pushed the rest of the world into danger, only to now stall on compensation. Many are skeptical about the intentions behind wealthy nations' efforts to involve private capital in financing measures to combat climate change. At the last 29 climate conferences, affected countries have demanded $100 billion annually, yet global leaders have repeatedly broken their promises. Many argue that these are developed countries, but what kind of development are we talking about? They are major polluters, historically responsible for severe carbon emissions. They are obligated to provide this compensation to help save the planet. However, this funding or financing must not be conditional in any way, nor should it involve loans or contracts. It cannot be used to impose carbon credits, new hazardous technologies, or seeds. This fund must be secured to support the climate adaptation efforts of Bangladesh's rural population, which depend on local and diverse approaches, as well as to compensate for overall damage. New funding raises concerns At the COP29 conference, wealthy countries, including the European Union and the United States, have agreed to provide $300 billion annually to climate funds by 2035. The conference, originally scheduled to conclude on November 22, 2024, has been extended to November 23 due to protracted discussions among 200 nations. These lengthy negotiations aim to finalize a global climate fund plan for the next decade based on consensus. On November 22, a draft agreement for a $250 billion fund was proposed at the COP29 conference, chaired by Azerbaijan. However, developing nations rejected this amount as ‘offensively low’. The current proposal is intended to succeed the $100 billion funding commitment set to expire in 2025. However, discussions are ongoing not only about the total amount of funding but also about who will contribute and how much of it will be in the form of grants. Nonetheless, a comprehensive outcome has yet to be achieved, leaving various countries in a state of concern. Several wealthy countries, including the European Union, have suggested that other economically powerful nations, such as China and oil-rich Gulf states, should also be included in funding contributions. NativeClick Ads Meanwhile, developing countries argue that inadequate funding will hinder their ability to set ambitious targets for reducing carbon emissions. A group of developing nations has threatened to withdraw from the discussions if a final decision on the proposal is not reached. In order to address the increasing pressures from climate change-related damages, developing countries have been calling for an increase in funding. If wealthy nations fail to fulfill their commitments through this proposal, divisions in future climate conferences may deepen further. What constitutes loss and damage resulting from climate change? The consequences of climate change manifest as increasingly frequent and severe floods, heatwaves, storms, and rising sea levels. While some individuals can adapt to these environmental changes, there are numerous situations where adaptation is not feasible: lives are lost, protective barriers are breached, land becomes unproductive, habitats undergo irreversible changes, and livestock perish. The unavoidable social and economic repercussions of climate change are termed ""loss and damage."" Loss and damage can be categorized into economic and non-economic types. Economic losses encompass financial detriments experienced by businesses, such as the significant heatwaves in India that have led to decreased wheat yields, adversely impacting the livelihoods of numerous farmers. This category also includes the destruction of property and infrastructure, exemplified by homes being swept away in increasingly severe floods. Non-economic loss and damage may involve the tragic loss of lives, as well as the erosion of cultural traditions, indigenous knowledge, biodiversity, and essential ecosystem services. What is the impact of loss and damage on Bangladesh and South Asia? From 2019 to 2023, approximately 82.1 million individuals were affected by weather-related disasters in South Asia, as reported by the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters. In 2022, South Asia accounted for the majority of natural disaster-related fatalities in Asia, largely due to the ""unprecedented"" floods in Pakistan that year, which impacted an estimated 33 million people. Numerous reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have highlighted South Asia's heightened vulnerability to extreme weather events. As global temperatures rise, the frequency and intensity of such disasters are expected to increase, potentially leading to significant loss and damage for the South Asian region. Considering the significant economic and humanitarian consequences of these changes, the methods by which the world assesses and compensates for loss and damage are critically important for the future of South Asia and all developing nations. With lives and livelihoods on the line, countries in this region and beyond are advocating for meaningful global discussions on loss and damage to facilitate their recovery and prepare for future challenges. What level of loss and damage will South Asia endure due to climate change? A study published in Nature in April 2024 projected that South Asia could face a median income reduction of 22% by 2050 as a result of climate change effects. Additionally, a 2018 study conducted by Australia’s Crawford School of Public Policy estimated that a 3°C increase in global temperatures above pre-industrial levels could lead to a 2.1% decline in India’s GDP by 2037, escalating to 5.5% by 2067. As of 2022, nearly 65% of South Asians resided in rural areas reliant on agriculture, which constitutes 18% of the region's gross domestic product (GDP) and accounts for 42% of total employment. However, agriculture is significantly impacted by climate change, affecting crop yields, exacerbating market prices, and heightening regional food insecurity. A pivotal 2022 IPCC report on climate impacts highlighted those economic losses from floods, cyclones, and heatwaves, along with gradual crises such as diminishing agricultural productivity, would have a profound effect on South Asia. It is important to note that South Asia is already incurring substantial costs due to extreme weather events. A study by the NGO Germanwatch ranked India as the seventh most affected country by extreme weather in 2019, reporting that severe floods that year resulted in approximately USD 10 billion in damages, claiming 1,800 lives and displacing around 1.8 million individuals. Each year, Bangladesh and other South Asian nations also endure significant destruction from tropical cyclones. Although advancements in weather forecasting have considerably decreased the loss of life, homes and livelihoods are consistently devastated with each storm. Super cyclone Amphan, which struck India and Bangladesh in 2020, resulted in estimated losses of around USD 14 billion, displacing 2.4 million individuals in India and 2.5 million in Bangladesh. Four years later, cyclone Remal impacted the same area, leading to damages estimated at approximately USD 600 million, affecting sectors such as fisheries, housing, and infrastructure. As climate change progresses, such extreme weather events are expected to become increasingly severe and unpredictable, complicating the ability of meteorologists to provide timely warnings as storms form. A 2019 study, using 2005 price levels, projected that climate change-related loss and damage could cost South Asia USD 518 billion by 2050, with estimates potentially rising to USD 997 billion by 2070. Climate change threatens lives and futures of over 19 million children in Bangladesh. Photo Source Unicef Why is loss and damage a contentious topic? Loss and damage have emerged as a divisive issue in international climate discussions, primarily due to concerns regarding liability and compensation. Developed nations, which have historically contributed the most to greenhouse gas emissions since the industrial revolution, have been hesitant to agree to any international framework that could obligate them to compensate for the losses and damages caused by their emissions. In principle, such an agreement was established in 2023 during the UN’s annual climate change COP (Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change). Held in Dubai, COP28 saw the establishment and funding of a loss and damage fund. However, the initial financial commitments represented less than 0.2% of the total annual losses faced by developing countries. What does the Paris Agreement state regarding loss and damage? Article 8 of the Paris Agreement, which was signed in 2015 at COP21, addresses loss and damage. It emphasizes that the countries that are parties to the agreement acknowledge “the importance of averting, minimizing, and addressing loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change,” and they are encouraged to enhance collaboration in implementing effective solutions. The incorporation of specific language regarding loss and damage in the Paris Agreement provided a formal acknowledgment that developing nations had advocated for however, the manner in which it was articulated favored the interests of developed countries. Paragraph 52 of the decision accompanying the Paris Agreement clearly states: “Article 8 of the Agreement does not involve or provide a basis for any liability or compensation.” Consequently, the Paris Agreement does not impose any legally binding responsibilities on nations to tackle loss and damage related to climate change, nor does it specify any financial obligations to assist countries experiencing significant loss and damage. What is the extent of funding allocated for loss and damage? As the United Nations gradually works towards establishing a sufficient loss and damage fund, some independent initiatives have emerged to aid vulnerable nations. In 2021, a coalition of philanthropic organizations, spearheaded by the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, contributed USD 3 million towards a loss and damage finance facility. Additionally, during COP26 that same year, the Wallonia region of Belgium committed EUR 1 million (approximately USD 1.1 million), while Scotland, the host nation, pledged GBP 2 million (around USD 2.6 million). Nevertheless, these contributions are minimal compared to the projected financial needs. The 2019 publication, Loss and Damage from Climate Change, estimates that developing countries will require between USD 290 billion and USD 580 billion annually by 2030 to address loss and damage. This estimate, co-edited by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria and the London School of Economics, is based on 2005 price levels and reflects a broad range due to various potential emissions-reduction scenarios. Is the establishment of a sufficient loss and damage fund feasible? At COP28 in Dubai, developed nations pledged approximately USD 700 million towards the new loss and damage fund. This commitment included contributions from the United Arab Emirates, Germany, Italy, France, Japan, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Slovenia, the European Union, and the United States. This amount represents less than 1% of the projected USD 400 billion that developing nations need annually to address the losses and damages resulting from climate change. In light of this inadequate advancement, specialists from the Global South have started advocating for greater ambition through the New Collective Quantified Goal. Should this initiative gain traction in upcoming climate change conferences and negotiations, it has the potential to deliver a minimum of USD 1 trillion each year to developing countries, offered as grants and concessional financing. Looking forward to COP 30 The Government of Brazil will host the thirtieth Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC (COP 30), with a view to building on previous successes and paving the way for future ambition to effectively tackle the global challenge of climate change. COP30 will take place in Belém, Brazil, from 10-21 November this year, with the themes include: reducing greenhouse gas emissions. adaptation to climate change. climate finance for developing countries. To ensure that fund can effectively respond to the needs of people and communities affected by climate change, all countries must work together. At the COP-29 conference, important discussions took placed on how to provide financial assistance through various innovative methods, including bonds and insurance. The G7 countries, known as the Global Shield, also discussed pre-planned insurance and other financial support for low-income countries affected by climate disasters such as floods, droughts, and hurricanes. Additionally, there have been suggestions in recent conferences to divert attention from the true 'loss and damage' fund to some grants. Most representatives from poorer countries have expressed a desire for grants, not loans or insurance, as these could further increase the debt burden on countries in South and Southeast Asia. Moreover, the pledges made by wealthy nations are not sufficient. Some countries alone require several trillion dollars in assistance to address the damage caused by climate change. Neither wealthy countries nor international financial management can adequately solve these challenges. Naturally, the affected countries are looking ahead to COP-30. They will seek resolutions on the unfinished issues from recent conferences and assurances for funding from developing countries, including those in South Asia. Experts Opinion Md. Shamsuddoha from Bangladesh's climate research organization (CPRD) states that Western countries now plan to profit from climate change. This development worker notes that they have significant surplus capital and are looking to invest in poorer nations under the guise of carbon trading. There is a growing suspicion that a form of carbon capitalism is beginning to take shape. Environmental activist Syeda Rizwana Hasan, who is currently serving as Environment, Forest and Climate Change Adviser to the interim government of Bangladesh, stated that it is not possible to wait until 2030 to take effective action against climate change. Advocating for justice for those affected by climate change, she emphasized that developed countries must urgently reduce emissions to meet the 1.5 degrees Celsius target and fulfill their commitments under the Paris Agreement. She also highlighted how Bangladesh, as a climate-vulnerable country, is confronting the realities of climate change every day, underscoring the need for coordinated global initiatives. Syeda Rizwana Hasan noted that in 2024, two devastating floods caused $1.7 billion in damages in Bangladesh, equivalent to 1.8 percent of the national budget. Over the past 18 months, Bangladesh has been affected by 15 climate-related natural disasters, displacing 1.2 million people. Despite contributing only 0.4 percent to global greenhouse gas emissions, the country suffers extreme losses. She further stated that Bangladesh has set a target to reduce emissions by 22 percent by 2030, which includes an unconditional reduction of 27 million tons and a conditional reduction of 61 million tons. Achieving these targets will require $45 billion in domestic funding and $135 billion in international assistance. Developed countries need to strengthen their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) based on climate justice, reduce reliance on market mechanisms, and uphold their commitments to high-quality climate financing.","loss damag grow concern south asia","south asian countri includ bangladesh face immens irrevers loss climat chang support develop countri lack loss damag progress minim amidst

In areas that also suffered severe damage, such as the capital Naypiytaw and Sagaing in the country’s northwest, rescuers are said to be desperately searching for survivors trapped in collapsed buildings. In Bangkok in neighboring Thailand, a high-rise building under construction collapsed. Local officials say at least 11 people were killed and more than 70 others remain missing.

The Israeli military said in a statement that it attacked a Hezbollah militant ""who had recently directed Hamas operatives and assisted them."" The attack took place a few days after a previous strike by Israel on the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital, a Hezbollah stronghold known as the Dahiyeh. There was no immediate statement from Hezbollah on the identity of the target. Lebanese President Joseph Aoun condemned the latest Israeli airstrike on Tuesday, calling it a ""dangerous warning"" that signals premeditated intentions against Lebanon. Aoun said Israel's growing ""aggression"" requires Lebanon to intensify diplomatic outreach and mobilise international allies in support of the country's full sovereignty. Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam also condemned the Israeli strike and said it was a flagrant breach of U.N. Resolution 1701 and the ceasefire arrangement. Nawaf said that he has been closely monitoring the aftermath of the strike in coordination with the ministers of defence and interior. The strike appeared to have damaged the upper three floors of a building in Beirut's southern suburbs, a Reuters reporter at the scene said, with the balconies of those floors blown out.

"politics","https://www.risingbd.com/english/politics/news/111395","NY Times report on Bangladesh misleading, says CA press wing","01/04/2025","The New York Times article titled ""As Bangladesh Reinvents Itself, Islamist Hard-Liners See an Opening"" is a misleading one, said the Chief Adviser's Press Wing today (April 1). ""The New York Times article paints a troubling and one-sided view of Bangladesh, suggesting that the country is on the brink of being overtaken by religious extremism,"" the press wing said in a statement posted on its verified Facebook page - CA Press Wing Facts. This portrayal not only oversimplifies the political and social dynamics of the country but also risks unfairly smearing an entire nation of 180 million people, it mentioned. It is crucial to acknowledge the progress Bangladesh has made over the last year and the complexity of the situation, rather than relying on selective, incendiary examples that paint an inaccurate picture, according to the statement. Following is the detail of the statement: 1. Acknowledging Bangladesh's Progress and Challenges: While the article highlights certain incidents of religious tension and conservative movements, it overlooks the broader context of progress. Bangladesh has made substantial strides in improving the conditions for women, and the Interim Government has been particularly committed to their security and well-being. This is a government that has prioritised women's rights and security, a focus that stands in stark contrast to the bleak image painted in the article. One significant example is the ""Youth Festival 2025,"" where nearly 2.7 million girls from all corners of the country participated in 3,000 games and cultural activities. NativeClick Ads This widespread participation-across regions, marginalised communities, and even indigenous youth-underscores the thriving and dynamic engagement of women and girls in Bangladesh's social and cultural life. The fact that one soccer game faced opposition does not erase the success of the other 2,999 events, which were celebrated by countless participants and communities. To focus on a single interruption to one event misrepresents the vibrancy and determination of the country's youth, especially women. Another claim that Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus ""has not pushed back hard enough against extremist forces"" is not only false, but it also disregards his lifelong commitment to empowering women. As Chief Advisor Prof Yunus has been unwavering in his advocacy for women's rights. A father of two daughters, Yunus has built his entire career and the Grameen Bank around a deep belief in the power of women, which ultimately earned him the Nobel Prize. His dedication to advancing women's rights and protecting their freedoms is a cornerstone of his work and reputation. 2. Correcting Misconceptions About Religious Violence: In a country like Bangladesh, it is important to distinguish between political unrest and religious violence. Many of the clashes between different groups in the wake of Sheik Hasina's departure and since have been misrepresented as sectarian violence, when in reality, they were largely political in nature. Political factions often use religion to galvanise support, which complicates the issue and risks conflating political unrest with religious persecution. It is misleading to frame the entire situation as a sectarian conflict, as it ignores the true political and socio-economic factors at play. The Interim Government has made clear its commitment to protecting all minority communities, and its ongoing work with law enforcement and counterterrorism efforts underscores this commitment. Bangladesh's efforts to combat extremism through social reforms and collaboration with the international community should not be overshadowed by the spread of misinformation. 3. Bangladesh's Role on the Global Stage: Bangladesh is quietly transforming into one of Asia's economic powerhouses, with a growth trajectory that promises immense opportunities for global investors. Against all odds, Bangladesh's economy has stabilised, showing remarkable resilience. In the last seven months, exports have grown almost 12%. The banking sector has remained intact after the political upheaval, and the local currency exchange rate has held steady at around 123 BDT to the USD. Looking ahead, Bangladesh is projected to advance to become a middle income country by 2026, and potentially the world's 9th largest consumer market by 2030. Where is the recognition of the incredible work done by the 84-year-old Muhammad Yunus over the past eight months? He has been tirelessly crisscrossing the globe to secure a better future for Bangladesh. Just last week, during his visit to China, the Chinese government and businesses committed US$2.1 billion in loans, investments, and grants to Bangladesh. And next week, Dhaka will host the Investors Conference, bringing over 2,300 participants from 50 countries, including top officials from global companies like Meta, Uber, and Samsung. The world is increasingly recognising Bangladesh as a rising economic power. This is a story of hope, strength, and unprecedented opportunity-one that deserves to be told with the respect and attention it merits. 4. Avoiding Oversimplification and Smearing a Nation: The NY Times article provides a handful of incidents, such as the release of a man who hurled abuse at a woman, to paint a picture of a country spiraling into extremism. This approach is not only misleading but harmful. In a nation of 180 million people, it is unconscionable to define the entire country by a few isolated events. Bangladesh is a diverse and dynamic society with a rich history of resilience, culture, and progressive thought. Bangladesh is not alone in facing the challenge of religious extremism this is a global issue that many countries confront in different forms. However, Bangladesh has continuously worked to address these challenges through law enforcement, social reforms, and counterterrorism initiatives. The country's commitment to protecting its diverse population-whether Muslim, Hindu, Christian, or any other community-remains steadfast. While there will always be hardliners who spew hatred at rallies and on social media, it is our responsibility to deny them the oxygen their anger requires. Furthermore, the notion that the rise of extremism is an inevitable outcome of Bangladesh's political transition is far too deterministic. The country's democratic spirit and vibrant civil society are powerful forces that continue to hold back the full rise of extremist ideologies. While challenges remain, the long-term direction of Bangladesh will not be shaped solely by the actions of extremists. The people of Bangladesh, particularly its youth and women, are determined to continue the fight for a just, democratic, and inclusive society. Finally, Bangladesh's history of resilience, its commitment to democracy, and its focus on women's empowerment are all testaments to the fact that the country will continue to move forward, despite the challenges it faces. Rather than focusing on a few negative examples, we should recognise the broader picture of progress, resilience, and determination that defines Bangladesh today._BSS.","ny time report bangladesh mislead sai ca press wing","new york time articl titl bangladesh reinvent islamist hardlin see open mislead on say chief advis press wing todai april new york time articl paint troubl onesid view bangladesh suggest countri brink overtake religi extrem press wing say statement post verifi facebook page ca press wing fact portray oversimplifi polit social dynam countri also risk unfairli smear entir nation million peopl mention crucial acknowledg progress bangladesh make last year complex situat rather reli select incendiari exampl paint inaccur pictur accord statement follow detail statement acknowledg bangladesh progress challeng articl highlight certain incid religi tension conserv movement overlook broad context progress bangladesh make substanti stride improv condit woman interim govern particularli commit secur wellb governmentern prioritis woman right secur focu stand stark contrast bleak imag paint articl on signific exampl youth festiv nearli million girl corner countri particip game cultur activ nativeclick ad widespread participationacross region marginalis commun even indigen youthunderscor thrive dynam engag woman girl bangladesh social cultur life fact on soccer game face opposit era success event celebr countless particip commun focu singl interrupt on event misrepres vibranc determin countri youth especi woman anoth claim chief advis professor muhammad yunu push back hard enough extremist forc fals also disregard lifelong commit empow woman chief advisor prof yunu unwav advocaci woman right father two daughter yunu build entir career grameen bank around deep belief power woman ultim earn nobel prize dedic advanc woman right protect freedom cornerston work reput correct misconcept religi violenc countri like bangladesh import distinguish polit unrest religi violenc mani clash differ group wake sheik hasina departur sinc misrepres sectarian violenc realiti larg polit natur polit faction often us religion galvanis support complic issu risk conflat polit unrest religi persecut mislead frame entir situat sectarian conflict ignor true polit socioeconom factor plai interim govern make clear commit protect minor commun ongo work law enforc counterterror effort underscor commit bangladesh effort combat extrem social reform collabor intern commun overshadow spread misinform bangladesh role global stage bangladesh quietli transform on asia econom powerhous growth trajectori promis immens opportun global investor odd bangladesh economi stabilis show remark resili last seven month export grow almost bank sector remain intact polit upheav local currenc exchang rate hold steadi around bdt usd look ahead bangladesh project advanc becom middl incom countri potenti world th large consum market recognit incred work do yearold muhammad yunu past eight month tirelessli crisscross globe secur good futur bangladesh just last week visit china chine governmentern busi commit u billion loan invest grant bangladesh next week dhaka will host investor confer bring particip countri includ top offici global compani like meta uber samsung world increasingli recognis bangladesh rise econom power stori hope strength unpreced opportunityon deserv tell respect attent merit avoid oversimplif smear nation ny time articl provid hand incid releas man hurl abus woman paint pictur countri spiral extrem approach mislead harm nation million peopl unconscion defin entir countri isol event bangladesh diver dynam societi rich histori resili cultur progress think bangladesh alon face challeng religi extrem global issu mani countri confront differ form howev bangladesh continu work address challeng law enforc social reform counterterror initi countri commit protect diver populationwheth muslim hindu christian communityremain steadfast will alwai hardlin spew hatr ralli social medium respons deni oxygen anger requir furthermor notion rise extrem inevit outcom bangladesh polit transit far determinist countri democrat spirit vibrant civil societi power forc continu hold back full rise extremist ideologi challeng remain longterm direct bangladesh will shape sole action extremist peopl bangladesh particularli youth woman determin continu fight just democrat inclus societi final bangladesh histori resili commit democraci focu woman empower testament fact countri will continu move forward despit challeng face rather focus neg exampl recognis broad pictur progress resili determin defin bangladesh todaybss"

The Israeli military said the official - Hassan Bdeir - was a member of a Hezbollah unit and Iran’s Quds Force, and he had assisted the Palestinian group Hamas in planning a “significant and imminent terror attack against Israeli civilians”. The attacks on Beirut’s southern suburbs have resumed at a time of broader escalation in the region, with Israel having restarted Gaza strikes after a two-month truce and the United States hitting the Iran-aligned Houthis of Yemen in a bid to get them to stop attacking Red Sea shipping. Hezbollah lawmaker Ibrahim Moussawi said the Israeli attack amounted to “a major and severe aggression that has escalated the situation to an entirely different level”. Speaking in a televised statement after visiting the building that was struck, he called on the Lebanese state to “activate the highest level of diplomacy to find solutions”. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said the eliminated Hezbollah operative posed “a real and immediate threat”. “We expect Lebanon to take action to uproot terrorist organizations acting within its borders against Israel,” he said. Israel dealt severe blows to Hezbollah in the war, killing thousands of its fighters, destroying much of its arsenal and eliminating its top leadership, including Hassan Nasrallah. Hezbollah has denied any role in recent rocket attacks from Lebanon towards Israel, including one that prompted Israel to carry out an airstrike on the southern suburbs last Friday.","israel kill hezbollah offici beirut airstrik","isra airstrik kill hezbollah offici three other beirut’ southern suburb tuesdai lebanes secur sourc say test shaki ceasefir israel iranback hezbollah reuter report isra militari say offici hassan bdeir member hezbollah unit iran’ qud forc assist palestinian group hama plan signific immin terror attack isra civilian attack beirut’ southern suburb resum time broad escal region israel restart gaza strike twomonth truce unit state hit iranalign houthi yemen bid get stop attack red sea ship hezbollah lawmak ibrahim moussawi say isra attack amount major sever aggress escal situat entir differ level speak televis statement visit build strike call lebanes state activ high level diplomaci find solut isra foreign minist gideon saar say elimin hezbollah oper pose real immedi threat expect lebanon take action uproot terrorist organ act within border israel say israel deal sever blow hezbollah war kill thousand fighter destroi much arsen elimin top leadership includ hassan nasrallah hezbollah deni role recent rocket attack lebanon toward israel includ on prompt israel carri airstrik southern suburb last fridai"

Speaking at the White House, Trump flagged that India imposes a 52% tariff on US imports, describing it as “very tough”. Recalling his interaction with PM Modi on bilateral trade during his visit to the US in February, Trump said, “The Prime Minister just left. He’s a great friend of mine, but I said, ‘You’re a friend of mine, but you’re not treating us right’. They charge us 52%. We charge them almost nothing for years and years and decades.” The reciprocal tariff rate of 27% includes a 10% universal tariff. The universal 10% tariff will come into effect on all imports into the US from April 5, and the remaining 17% from April 10, a government official said. The move is likely to hurt India’s exports of agricultural and pharmaceutical goods to the US.

Besides, the experts said that an understanding must be reached with the US administration is needed as soon as possible to overcome this situation. At the same time, alternative markets for ready-made garments and other export products must be found. Experts and business leaders opined that Trump's tariffs will increase inflation in the United States, reducing the purchasing power of the country's citizens. This will reduce garment exports. It will take time to overcome this crisis by exporting ready-made garments to new markets, according to the experts. Economists in the country said that the United States has increased tariffs not only on Bangladeshi products but also on products from various countries around the world. There is a risk of inflation in the country due to the imposition of high tariffs. As inflation rises and consumer purchasing power declines, there is also a risk that the US economy will fall into a recession. As the United States is the top destination for ready-made garment exports, exports will decrease ultimately. It will have a negative impact on overall export earnings. However, if the government can reduce tariffs through negotiations with the US administration, the fear of a decline in export earnings would be fairly alleviated, experts opined. Former director of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), Md. Mohiuddin Rubel said, “The United States has imposed or increased additional tariffs on products from around 60 countries. It will have an impact on those countries. The purchasing power of US citizens will decrease, inflation will increase, which will not be good for the country. Businessmen are worried about this.” If the Bangladesh government works on this, tariffs could be reduced, he added. NativeClick Ads BKMEA Executive President Fazlee Shamim Ehsan opined that tariff wars are not desirable in the modern world. These tariffs will not bring much success to the American economy. The profit margin on our exported products is very low. The United States thinks these products will be made in the USA. That is not possible. As these industries are labor-intensive based industries.” Initially we will face a storm for this tariff. Because buyers are always opportunists. Buyers will try to reduce the price of our products, he added. Zahid Hossain, former chief economist at the World Bank's Dhaka office, said there is no doubt that the new US tariff policy will have a negative impact on Bangladesh's exports. In addition to its impact on Bangladesh, Trump's tariff war will also affect the US economy, he said.","econom expert predict bangladeshi","businessman express concern futur u presid donald trump percent tariff bangladeshi export even though decis yet make besid expert say understand must reach u administr need soon possibl overcom situat time altern market readymad garment export product must find expert busi leader opin trump tariff will increas inflat unit state reduc purchas power countri citizen will reduc garment export will take time overcom crisi export readymad garment new market accord expert economist countri say unit state increas tariff bangladeshi product also product variou countri around world risk inflat countri due imposit high tariff inflat rise consum purchas power declin also risk u economi will fall recess unit state top destin readymad garment export export will decreas ultim will neg impact overal export earn howev governmentern can reduc tariff negoti u administr fear declin export earn fairli allevi expert opin former director bangladesh garment manufactur export associ bgmea md mohiuddin rubel say unit state impos increas addit tariff product around countri will impact countri purchas power u citizen will decreas inflat will increas will good countri businessman worri bangladesh governmentern work tariff reduc ad nativeclick ad bkmea execut presid fazle shamim ehsan opin tariff war desir modern world tariff will bring much success american economi profit margin export product low unit state think product will make usa possibl industri laborintens base industri initi will face storm tariff buyer alwai opportunist buyer will try reduc price product ad zahid hossain former chief economist world bank dhaka offic say doubt new u tariff polici will neg impact bangladesh export addit impact bangladesh trump tariff war will also affect u economi say"

The court’s Acting Chief Justice Moon Hyung-bae opened the proceeding on Friday by declaring that there was sufficient reason to impeach President Yoon. “The defendant mobilised military and police forces to dismantle the authority of constitutional institutions and infringed upon the fundamental rights of the people,” the acting chief justice said while reading the court’s decision. “In doing so, he abandoned his constitutional duty to uphold the constitution and gravely betrayed the trust of the Korean people,” the chief justice said. “Such unlawful and unconstitutional conduct constitutes an act that cannot be tolerated under the constitution,” he said. “The negative consequences and ripple effects of these actions are substantial, and the benefit of restoring constitutional order through removal from office outweighs the national costs associated with the dismissal of a sitting president,” he added. The Constitutional Court’s decision was unanimous, Hyung-bae said. The ruling on Friday now means that South Korea must hold a presidential election within 60 days.

The chief adviser made the remarks while speaking at the 6th Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) Summit in Bangkok, Thailand. Highlighting the aspects of the July uprising in Bangladesh, he said in 1971, hundreds of thousands of ordinary women and men, children and youth made supreme sacrifice in a nine-month long genocide, fighting against a brutal military. “Our people aspired for an inclusive, just and free society where every ordinary person could materialise his or her dreams. “Sadly, in the course of past fifteen years, our people, especially youth, progressively saw their spaces and rights curtailed. They witnessed deep erosion of almost every State institution and civic rights trampled,” Prof Yunus said. He said the common mass brought an end to the brutal authoritarian regime, at the expense of lives of close to 2,000 innocent people, mostly youth, including 118 children. “The people of Bangladesh witnessed a rebirth in her history,” he added. NativeClick Ads The chief adviser said the student leaders, who led the uprising and freed the country from the corrupt and autocratic regime of Sheikh Hasina, appealed to him to lead the country during this crucial juncture of the country’s history. “I agreed to take the responsibility, for the sake of our people,” he added. He said the interim government is pledged-bound to undertake robust and far-reaching reforms to restore economic stability and sustained growth. “We are committed to good governance, combating corruption and bringing order to every sphere of economy. These are at the core of the reforms we have planned,” Prof Yunus said. The interim government constituted six Commissions to recommend reforms to the judiciary, the electoral system, public administration, police, the anti-corruption office, and the constitution to ensure public ownership, accountability and welfare of the people, he said. The chief adviser said the commissions have already submitted their recommendations, which are under active consideration of the government. “We have formed a seven-member ‘Jatiya Oaikyamot (Consensus) Commission’ headed by me and comprising the chiefs of all the six Commissions to consider and adopt the recommendations submitted by the individual commissions,” he said. Prof Yunus said the interim government has also formed four additional commissions recently to make policy recommendations on media, health, labor and women’s rights. “As we rebuild Bangladesh, we will continue to work steadfastly to ensure the constitutional rights of every citizen of the country whether they are women or members of ethnic and religious minorities,” he said.

"politics","https://www.risingbd.com/english/politics/news/111441","CA urges BIMSTEC to work together for shared benefits","04/04/2025","Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus on Friday (April 4) urged BIMSTEC to work together for mutuality of interests and shared benefits as he addressed the 6th BIMSTEC Summit here. “Bangladesh has long nurtured the vision of open regionalism. We envision a region where all the countries and communities can engage based on equity, mutual respect, mutuality of interests and shared benefits,” he said. The chief adviser said BIMSTEC region hosts one-fifth of the global population while challenges abound, converting those challenges into opportunities holding considerable prospect for all. “Many label our demography as a ‘challenge’. Yet, there are enough instances to illustrate the untapped ‘promises’ of our population,” he said. In hosting the BIMSTEC Secretariat, he said, Bangladesh stands ready to unlock the vast potential of an organisation in a meaningful way. About the potential of BIMSTEC, Prof Yunus said energy security is fundamental to the sustainable development and economic resilience of the BIMSTEC region. “We must work together to harness our collective potential in renewable energy, cross-border electricity trade, and energy efficiency to ensure a secure and sustainable future for our people,” he said. Prof Yunus said he is confident that the BIMSTEC Agreement on Grid Interconnection signed in 2018 can act as a launching pad for cooperation in the field of energy. NativeClick Ads “As per our BIMSTEC commitment we are committed to enhancing connectivity, improving mutual trade and economic collaboration among all member countries,” he said. He also said promoting trade and investment, facilitating movements of people particularly of the young boys and girls within BIMSTEC is key to enhancing wellbeing of their people. “Currently, intra-regional trade stands at just 5.9%. As the lead country in Trade, Investment and Development Sector, Bangladesh would urge all to materialise implementation of the BIMSTEC Framework Agreement on FTA that we signed way back in 2004, that will ultimately contribute towards better connectivity,” he said. The BIMSTEC Master Plan on Transport Connectivity was adopted at the fifth BIMSTEC Summit, the chief adviser said, adding that its timely implementation is crucial for the countries. He said: “Some of the countries have accomplished much bilaterally. In order to reap the benefits of effective regional economic integration and development, the regional measures need to be materialised.” Bangladesh stands ready to extend all possible support for the implementation of the Master Plan, he added. Prof Yunus said the BIMSTEC Agreement on Maritime Transport Cooperation was signed yesterday, which will certainly contribute towards enhanced connectivity within BIMSTEC region particularly with the landlocked member states and seven sisters of India. Noting that the BIMSTEC has been in existence for 28 long years, he said to be candid, its impacts are not still felt across the member states and beyond. He said signing and ratification of the Charter and formulation of the relevant Rules of Procedure has accorded the BIMSTEC processes and institutions considerable strength. “Our civil society and private sector particularly stress BIMSTEC to take up tangible and result-oriented initiatives, and projects amongst our countries,” the chief adviser said. As Bangladesh assumes the BIMSTEC Chairmanship, he called upon all member states to extend their valued support in redeeming their collective commitments to revitalise the organisation. “We need a genuinely shared sense of mutual confidence and mutuality of interests, rising above our differences and divergences. Whatever we undertake or do collectively, we need to be driven by impact and results,” he said. The chief adviser stressed rediscovering the modalities and institutions of regional and sub-regional collaboration under the BIMSTEC. Addressing inequality of income and choices, balancing economy and ecology need to be overriding objectives in pursuing their sectoral cooperation, he said. “While each of our countries pursue our national interests, we also need to appreciate the same of ‘others’ in the table in shaping and moving our wider cooperative agenda,” Prof Yunus said. In a fast-moving world, comparing the developments of the past decade seems a bit distant past, he said, adding many of long-held norms, regulations are giving in. “I find institutions often struggling to meet people’s aspirations. In making our institutions fit-for-purpose, I have been advocating for an overhaul of the financial system as also launch innovative social businesses that would uphold dignity and ensure an individual’s security, not just augment wealth,” he said. Within and beyond the region, resources - capacities - solutions abound to address many of our endemic challenges, like climate change, the chief adviser said. “As much as we facilitate knowledge and technology amongst our seven countries, let us also open up to the world – the governments, the knowledge institutions, foundations, private sector – who would share our values and appreciate our needs,” he added. Thai Prime Minister and Chairperson of the Summit Paetongtarn Shinawatra, BIMSTEC Secretary General Ambassador Indra Mani Pandey and distinguished heads of delegations from the BIMSTEC member states were present on the occasion.

The upper house passed the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024 early on Friday, a day after the lower house cleared it amid strong opposition criticism. Muslim leaders and opposition parties say the bill is ""unconstitutional"" and infringes on the rights of India's Muslim-minority community. But the government says the bill aims to make the management of waqf (Muslim properties) more transparent. The bill will now be sent to India's president for her assent before it becomes law. This approval is expected to come soon. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the passing of the bill a ""watershed moment"". In a post on X, he said the waqf system [the system of governing waqf or Muslim properties] had been ""synonymous with a lack of transparency and accountability"" for decades. ""The legislation passed by parliament will boost transparency and also safeguard people's rights,"" he wrote. NativeClick Ads However, the opposition has been vociferous in their condemnation of the bill and allege that it is another ploy by the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to dilute the rights of minorities. Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge noted that while 288 members voted in favour of the bill in the lower house, a significant 232 opposed it. ""From this, we can guess that despite opposition from various parties, this bill was brought arbitrarily,"" he wrote on X. In Islamic tradition, a waqf is a charitable or religious donation made by Muslims for the benefit of the community. Such properties cannot be sold or used for any other purpose. They are important to India's 200 million Muslims as they are used for mosques, madrassas, graveyards and orphanages. The properties are governed by the Waqf Act, 1995, which mandated the formation of state-level boards to manage them. These boards include nominees from the state government, Muslim lawmakers, members of the state bar council, Islamic scholars and managers of waqf properties. Last August, the BJP government introduced a bill to amend the Waqf Act. The government said the changes proposed by the bill would modernise waqf administration and reduce legal loopholes. But Muslim leaders and opposition parties alleged that the amendments would give the government more control over these properties. The bill was sent to a panel for scrutiny. In February, the panel cleared the bill with some amendments._Agencies.","india pass controversi bill muslim properti","hour heat debat india parliament pass controversi bill seek chang properti worth billion dollar donat muslim centuri governmentern report bbc upper hous pass waqf amend bill earli fridai dai low hous clear amid strong opposit critic muslim leader opposit parti sai bill unconstitut infring right india muslimminor commun governmentern sai bill aim make manag waqf muslim properti transpar bill will now send india presid assent becom law approv expect come soon prime minist narendra modi call pass bill watersh moment post x say waqf system system governmentern waqf muslim properti synonym lack transpar account decad legisl pass parliament will boost transpar also safeguard peopl right write nativeclick ad howev opposit vocifer condemn bill alleg anoth ploi governmentern bharatiya janata parti bjp dilut right minor congress leader mallikarjun kharg note member vote favour bill low hous signific oppos can guess despit opposit variou parti bill bring arbitrarili write x islam tradit waqf charit religi donat make muslim benefit commun properti sell us purpos import india million muslim us mosqu madrassa graveyard orphanag properti governmentern waqf act mandat format statelevel board manag board includ nomine state governmentern muslim lawmak member state bar council islam scholar manag waqf properti last august bjp governmentern introduc bill amend waqf act governmentern say chang propos bill modernis waqf administr reduc legal loophol muslim leader opposit parti alleg amend give governmentern control properti bill send panel scrutini februari panel clear bill amendmentsag"

That exotic world is TOI-421 b, a boiling-hot ""sub-Neptune"" orbiting a star about 244 light-years from Earth whose atmosphere JWST recently probed in detail, reports space.com. ""One of the most exciting prospects in exoplanet science today is discovering the origin and makeup of sub-Neptunes, which are high-occurrence planets that have no solar system analog,"" the study team wrote in their paper, which was published Monday (May 5) in The Astronomical Journal Letters. Although JWST was specifically designed for this kind of investigation, the discovery is particularly exciting because little is known about this class of planets, which were first identified by NASA's pioneering Kepler space telescope. Before JWST, attempts to study the atmospheres of sub-Neptune planets using transmission spectra — the measurement of starlight filtered through a planet's atmosphere when it passes in front of its host star — often yielded flat or featureless spectra. So, rather than showing chemical fingerprints that could indicate the presence of atmospheric molecules like carbon dioxide, methane or water vapor, the spectra of sub-Neptunes have generally offered little useful information. Astronomers proposed that this lack of detail might be due to clouds or hazes, which could be obscuring the signals. But the study team thought that TOI-421 b might be different, and could therefore offer a unique opportunity. Previous observations with NASA's Hubble Space Telescope had shown that flat spectral features are common among sub-Neptunes with temperatures below about 1,070 degrees Fahrenheit (577 degrees Celsius). ""Sub-Neptunes hotter [than this threshold] are also expected to be haze free because methane, and thus the hydrocarbon precursors to haze formation, should be less abundant as carbon monoxide becomes the dominant carbon-bearing molecule,"" the team wrote in the new study. NativeClick Ads TOI-421 b, with an estimated atmospheric temperature of 1,340 degrees Fahrenheit (727 degrees C), falls into this potentially haze-free category — and, after observing two transits using JWST's Near Infrared Spectrograph and Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph instruments, the team was rewarded with a rich atmospheric profile. ""We saw spectral features that we attribute to various gases, and that allowed us to determine the composition of the atmosphere,"" Brian Davenport, a Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland who conducted the primary data analysis, said in the same statement. The team detected water vapor in TOI-421 b's atmosphere, along with possible signs of carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide. Notably, they did not find evidence of methane or carbon dioxide. The data also suggest that the atmosphere contains a significant amount of hydrogen. Some of these findings are surprising, challenging existing theories about the formation and evolution of sub-Neptune planets. ""We had recently wrapped our mind around the idea that those first few sub-Neptunes observed by Webb had heavy-molecule atmospheres, so that had become our expectation, and then we found the opposite,"" said Kempton. This means TOI-421 b may have formed and evolved differently than cooler sub-Neptunes, such as TOI-270 d, which was observed previously. The hydrogen-rich atmosphere is especially intriguing because it closely mirrors the composition of TOI-421 b's host star._Agencies.","nasa find water air exot subneptun exoplanet","nasa jame webb space telescop jwst find water swirl air distant alien planet new studi report exot world toi b boilinghot subneptun orbit star lightyear earth whose atmospher jwst recent probe detail report spacecom on excit prospect exoplanet scienc todai discov origin makeup subneptun highoccurr planet solar system analog studi team write paper publish mondai mai astronom journal letter although jwst specif design kind investig discoveri particularli excit littl know class planet first identifi nasa pioneer kepler space telescop jwst attempt studi atmospher subneptun planet us transmiss spectrum measur starlight filter planet atmospher pass front host star often yield flat featureless spectrum rather show chemic fingerprint indic presenc atmospher molecul like carbon dioxid methan water vapor spectrum subneptun gener offer littl us inform astronom propos lack detail may due cloud haze obscur signal studi team think toi b may differ therefor offer uniqu opportun previou observ nasa hubbl space telescop show flat spectral featur common among subneptun temperatur degre fahrenheit degre celsiu subneptun hot threshold also expect haze free methan thu hydrocarbon precursor haze format little abund carbon monoxid becom domin carbonbear molecul team write new studi nativeclick ad toi b estim atmospher temperatur degre fahrenheit degre c fall potenti hazefre categori observ two transit us jwst near infrar spectrograph near infrar imag slitless spectrograph instrument team reward rich atmospher profil see spectral featur attribut variou gase allow u determin composit atmospher brian davenport phd student univers maryland conduct primari datum analysi say statement team detect water vapor toi b atmospher along possibl sign carbon monoxid sulfur dioxid notabl find evid methan carbon dioxid datum also suggest atmospher contain signific amount hydrogen find surpris challeng exist theori format evolut subneptun planet recent wrap mind around idea first subneptun observ webb heavymolecul atmospher becom expect find opposit say kempton mean toi b mai form evolv differ cool subneptun toi have observ previous hydrogenrich atmospher especi intrigu close mirror composit toi b host starag"

The decision marks a new blow to Brazilian football, which celebrated some rare good news just four days ago with the announcement that Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti will take the reins of the national team later in May. The Rio court said one of the signatories of Rodrigues’s 2025 contract had been mentally unfit to sign, meaning there had been “possible forgery”. As a result, the judge ruled in a judgment that the employment agreement between Rodrigues and the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) was “null” and void. The judge also ordered that the federation hold new leadership elections. The CBF’s interim president Fernando Jose Sarney said in a statement that the federation would abide by the ruling and call elections “as soon as possible”. But Brazilian media reported that the body had also appealed the judge’s ruling to the Supreme Court. Rodrigues, the first Black president of the CBF, told journalists at a Fifa meeting in Asuncion ahead of the ruling that he had “absolute certainty” the document was valid.

The plan is under serious enough consideration that the US has discussed it with Libya’s leadership, the report said, while stressing a final agreement has yet to be reached. In exchange for resettling the Palestinians, the administration would release to Libya billions of dollars of funds the US froze more than a decade ago, NBC added. According to three of the sources quoted in the report, Israel has been kept in the loop about the administration’s talks on the matter. “These reports are untrue,” an administration spokesperson told NBC in response. “The situation on the ground is untenable for such a plan. Such a plan was not discussed and makes no sense.” There was no response from Israel or either of Libya’s two rival governments the report, which also said administration officials have discussed offering incentives such as free housing and possibly a financial stipend to encourage Palestinians to leave Gaza for the North African country. An official told the US network that it remains unclear where one million Palestinians from Gaza could be settled in the largely lawless Libya, which has been plunged into chaos and division since the 2011 civil war in which longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi was overthrown and killed. The NBC report also noted the logistical challenges involved in transporting one million people from Gaza to Libya, particularly with no airport in the Strip. NativeClick Ads US President Donald Trump triggered global perplexity in early February by suggesting the US “take over” Gaza and turn it into a “Middle East Riviera” while forcing its Palestinian inhabitants to relocate to Egypt, Jordan, or other countries. He has since said, however, that no Gazans would be expelled. Visiting the Middle East this week, Trump said he wanted the United States to “take” Gaza and turn it into a “freedom zone”: “I have concepts for Gaza that I think are very good. Make it a freedom zone. Let the United States get involved and make it just a freedom zone,” he said. “I’d be proud to have the United States have it, take it, make it a freedom zone.” While far-right ministers in Israel have urged using the ongoing war with Hamas as an opportunity to reestablish Israeli settlements in the Strip lauded the plan, the Palestinian Authority and Arab nations rejected it outright. Despite public opposition among the region’s leaders, the government has moved forward with plans to encourage Palestinians to relocate, though The Times of Israel found no meaningful change in Israel’s exit policy for Gaza residents in recent months.","u want move lakh palestinian libya gaza","trump administr work plan perman reloc much on million lakh palestinian gaza strip libya nbc new report fridai cite five peopl knowledg matter plan seriou enough consider u discuss libya’ leadership report say stress final agreement yet reach exchang resettl palestinian administr releas libya billion dollar fund u freeze decad ago nbc ad accord three sourc quot report israel keep loop administration’ talk matter report untru administr spokesperson tell nbc respons situat grind unten plan plan discuss make sens respons israel either libya’ two rival governmentern report also say administr offici discuss offer incent free hous possibli financi stipend encourag palestinian leav gaza north african countri offici tell u network remain unclear on million palestinian gaza settl larg lawless libya plung chao divis sinc civil war longtim dictat moammar gadhafi overthrow kill nbc report also note logist challeng involv transport on million peopl gaza libya particularli airport strip nativeclick ad u presid donald trump trigger global perplex earli februari suggest u take gaza turn middl east riviera forc palestinian inhabit reloc egypt jordan countri sinc say howev gazan expel visit middl east week trump say want unit state take gaza turn freedom zone concept gaza think good make freedom zone let unit state get involv make just freedom zone say i’d proud unit state take make freedom zone farright minist israel urg us ongo war hama opportun reestablish isra settlement strip laud plan palestinian author arab nation reject outright despit public opposit among region’ leader governmentern move forward plan encourag palestinian reloc though time israel find mean chang israel’ exit polici gaza resid recent month"

"national","https://www.risingbd.com/english/national/news/112431","Indian authorities threw 43 Rohingya refugees into sea","17/05/2025","Indian authorities have allegedly thrown 40 Rohingya refugees detained from New Delhi into international waters near the maritime border with Myanmar, forcing children, women, and the elderly to swim to safety with life jackets provided to them. The inhumane operation reportly happened on 08 May, the day Solicitor General assured the Supreme Court of India that any deportation would be carried out strictly in accordance with the procedure established by law. The United Nations has called for an investigation into “credible reports” that Indian authorities rounded up Rohingya refugees and expelled them, in some cases by putting them into the Andaman Sea off the shore of the same country they had escaped from, fearing persecution and death. “The idea that Rohingya refugees have been cast into the sea from naval vessels is nothing short of outrageous,” said Tom Andrews, the U.N. special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar. “I am seeking further information and testimony regarding these developments and implore the Indian government to provide a full accounting of what happened.” He urged the Indian government to refrain from “inhumane and life-threatening treatment of Rohingya refugees, including their repatriation into perilous conditions in Myanmar.” The Indian government did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Officials of right-wing governments across several Indian states rounded up thousands of Muslims, purportedly Rohingya or Bangladeshi people living illegally in India. Such labels, along with “Pakistani,” are often used to target Muslim migrants from other parts of India. The most sweeping actions were in Gujarat, in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home state, and in Rajasthan. While a majority of those detained turned out to be Indian citizens and were later released, those who were identified as Rohingya and Bangladeshi have been deported in large numbers, including some with refugee documents that were supposed to give them protection. The People’s Union for Civil Liberties, an India-based human rights group, criticized the move. “At the very least, the Rohingyas are entitled to due process under existing law which requires that the detainee get notice, opportunity of hearing and representation,” the group said in a statement. NativeClick Ads Rohingya refugees in Delhi said Indian authorities had rounded up dozens of them last week. They were taken to a police station, and never returned. Sadeq Shalom, a Rohingya Christian refugee in New Delhi who works as an education consultant, said his older brother and several other family members were picked up and were part of a group of 40 people who were put into the sea. He said 15 of the 40 were Christians, and their pleas that they faced double persecution — as Rohingya from the state, and then as a Christian minority from the Muslim majority in their area — were in vain. Another refugee in New Delhi, David Nazir, said his elderly parents were picked up and were also among the 40 people put to sea. He learned what had happened to them only after Mr. Shalom got a call from his brother, who borrowed a fisherman’s phone upon reaching Myanmar’s shore. “He told me that the Indian authorities had forced them off a navy vessel in the Andaman Sea and made them swim into Myanmar territory with nothing but life jackets,” Mr. Shalom said in an interview. Their biggest fear, Mr. Nazir said, was that the Myanmar army, which they had fled, was waiting for them. But in his phone call, Mr. Shalom’s brother said that all 40 were safe with the National Unity Government of Myanmar, which began operating in resistance after the country’s 2021 military coup. Colin Gonsalves, a lawyer representing the Rohingya in India’s supreme court, said there are about 1,000 who have sought refuge in Delhi and about 20,000 all over India. On social media, the Indian government’s actions drew comparisons to how India’s own immigrants were recently deported from the United States by the Trump administration, sent home by plane in shackles — a move that spurred widespread outrage. Mr. Gonsalves said that his appeal at the country’s supreme court to put a pause on the deportations was rejected. “We expect a little more compassion,” Mr. Gonsalves said. “Throwing refugees into the sea and then they land up in a war zone is one of the most barbaric practices a nation can indulge in.” Source: Agencies","indian author throw rohingya refuge sea","indian author allegedli throw rohingya refuge detain new delhi intern water near maritim border myanmar forc child woman elderli swim safeti life jacket provid inhuman oper reportli happen mai dai solicitor gener assur suprem court india deport carri strictli accord procedur establish law unit nation call investig credibl report indian author round rohingya refuge expel case put andaman sea shore countri escap fear persecut death idea rohingya refuge cast sea naval vessel noth short outrag say tom andrew un special rapporteur situat human right myanmar seek inform testimoni regard develop implor indian governmentern provid full account happen urg indian governmentern refrain inhuman lifethreaten treatment rohingya refuge includ repatri peril condit myanmar indian governmentern immedi respond request comment offici rightw governmentern across sever indian state round thousand muslim purportedli rohingya bangladeshi peopl live illeg india label along pakistani often us target muslim migrant part india sweep action gujarat prime minist narendra modi’ home state rajasthan major detain turn indian citizen late releas identifi rohingya bangladeshi deport larg numb includ refuge document suppos give protect people’ union civil liberti indiabas human right group critic move less rohingya entitl due process exist law requir detaine get notic opportun hear represent group say statement nativeclick ad rohingya refuge delhi say indian author round dozen last week take polic station never return sadeq shalom rohingya christian refuge new delhi work educ consult say old brother sever famili member pick part group peopl put sea say christian plea face doubl persecut rohingya state christian minor muslim major area vain anoth refuge new delhi david nazir say elderli parent pick also among peopl put sea learn happen mr shalom get call brother borrow fisherman’ phone upon reach myanmar’ shore tell indian author forc navi vessel andaman sea make swim myanmar territori noth life jacket mr shalom say interview big fear mr nazir say myanmar armi flee wait phone call mr shalom’ brother say safe nation uniti govern myanmar begin oper resist country’ militari coup colin gonsalv lawyer repres rohingya india’ suprem court say seek refug delhi india social medium indian governmenternment’ action draw comparison india’ immigr recent deport unit state trump administr send home plane shackl move spur widespread outrag mr gonsalv say appeal country’ suprem court put paus deport reject expect littl compass mr gonsalv say throw refuge sea land war zone on barbar practice nation can indulg sourc agenc"

The ISPR said that since 5 August last year, Naimul had been collaborating with several other dismissed or discharged ex-military personnel to make provocative statements in the media and plot subversive activities. “He planned a large-scale act of sabotage disguised as a protest rally at the entrance of Dhaka Cantonment on 18 May, and had been actively causing incitement through social media platforms,” reads the statement. To deter such disorderly conduct, a team from the army attempted to make contact with Naimul around 2:00pm on Saturday in the Khilkhet Bott Tola Bazar area. However, Naimul, along with several associates, allegedly launched a sudden attack with locally-made weapons on the military personnel present, said the ISPR. A nearby army patrol team quickly intervened, leading to the arrest of Naimul and two of his associates, the statement added. The ISPR also mentioned that Naimul had previously been dismissed from service due to multiple disciplinary violations, including allegations of demanding dowry from his wife, and committing both physical and mental abuse. Legal proceedings are currently underway against him, it said.","sabotag plot surround canton includ dismiss soldier detain","sabotag plot surround canton includ dismiss soldier detain dismiss soldier md naimul islam arrest charg instig sabotag caus disord accord statement issu interservic public relat ispr saturdai ispr say sinc august last year naimul collabor sever dismiss discharg exmilitari personnel make provoc statement medium plot subvers activ plan largescal act sabotag disguis protest ralli entranc dhaka canton mai activ caus incit social medium platform read statement deter disorderli conduct team armi attempt make contact naimul around pm saturdai khilkhet bott tola bazar area howev naimul along sever associ allegedli launch sudden attack locallymad weapon militari personnel present say ispr nearbi armi patrol team quickli interven lead arrest naimul two associ statement ad ispr also mention naimul previous dismiss servic due multipl disciplinari violat includ alleg demand dowri wife commit physic mental abus legal proceed current underwai say"
